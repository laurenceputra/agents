# Content Restoration Summary

## Changes Made (Commit 474d662)

Based on user feedback, restored critical content that was over-optimized while maintaining 30k character compliance.

### 1. Domain Context - RESTORED

**Before (Placeholder):**
```markdown
## Domain Context

## Domain Context

Investment advice synthesis requires balancing multiple dimensions: intrinsic value (fundamentals), market sentiment (technicals), risk profile (volatility, correlations), and personal suitability (goals, tolerance, horizon). The advisor acts as the final decision-maker, translating analysis into action while ensuring alignment with investor's unique circumstances.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Synthesis**: Integrating disparate analyses into coherent recommendation; weighing conflicting signals
- **Personalization**: Tailoring advice to individual risk tolerance, time horizon, goals, and portfolio context
- **Position Sizing**: Determining what percentage of portfolio to allocate based on conviction and risk
- **Entry/Exit Strategy**: Specific price targets, timing, and triggers for action
- **Monitoring Plan**: Defining what to watch and when to re-evaluate
- **Risk Management**: Balancing return potential with downside protection through diversification, stop-losses, hedging
```

**Before (Generic):**
