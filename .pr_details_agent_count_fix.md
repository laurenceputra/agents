# PR Title
docs: fix agent count discrepancies across all agent groups

# PR Description

## Summary
Corrects critical documentation inconsistencies where stated agent counts in README.md and copilot-instructions.md files did not match the actual number of agent implementation files across four agent groups.

## Changes Made
- **legacy-planning**: Corrected "four" → "five" agents (4 locations: README intro, 2 example summaries, version history)
- **stock-investment-analysis**: Corrected "five" → "seven" agents (3 locations: copilot-instructions intro, 2 version history entries with full agent list)
- **recommendation-letter**: Corrected "three" → "four" agents (3 locations: README intro, README version history, copilot-instructions version history with Devil's Advocate mention)
- **product-development-agents**: Added Devil's Advocate mention in version history (1 location)

**Total**: 11 text replacements across 7 files in 4 agent groups

## Context
Agent Validator identified critical documentation inconsistencies during quality review where documented agent counts did not match actual .agent.md file counts in agent directories. These discrepancies caused confusion about agent group composition and violated documentation accuracy standards.

**Verified Agent Counts**:
- legacy-planning: 5 agents (legacy-planning-advisor, trust-structure-designer, beneficiary-planning-agent, letter-of-wishes-composer, devils-advocate)
- stock-investment-analysis: 7 agents (stock-analysis-orchestrator, stock-researcher, fundamental-analyst, technical-analyst, risk-assessor, investment-advisor, devils-advocate)
- recommendation-letter: 4 agents (recommendation-profiler, recommendation-writer, recommendation-reviewer, devils-advocate)
- product-development-agents: 5 agents (product-manager, staff-engineer, code-reviewer, qa, devils-advocate)

## Impact
- **User Clarity**: Documentation now accurately reflects actual agent counts, eliminating confusion
- **Documentation Integrity**: Ensures users can trust agent group documentation
- **Devil's Advocate Visibility**: Properly documents Devil's Advocate agent where it was missing from version history
- **Consistency**: All agent groups now have accurate counts in introductions, examples, and version history

**No Functional Changes**: This is documentation-only correction. No agent implementations, workflows, or behaviors changed.

## Classification
**Type**: Documentation clarification (not a feature or bug fix)  
**Version Impact**: None (no version bumps required)  
**CHANGELOG**: No entries required (documentation correction only)

## Validation Performed
- ✅ Verified actual agent counts by listing .agent.md files in each agents/ directory
- ✅ Confirmed exact text matches for all 11 replacements
- ✅ Validated no old text patterns remain after changes
- ✅ Reviewed git diff to confirm only expected changes
- ✅ Ensured consistent terminology across all agent groups
