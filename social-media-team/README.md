## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Workflow

**Need strategy for ONE platform?** → Consult platform specialist directly
- `@facebook-specialist` for Facebook strategy
- `@instagram-specialist` for Instagram strategy  
- `@linkedin-specialist` for LinkedIn strategy

**Need strategy for MULTIPLE platforms?** → Start with coordinator
- `@social-media-coordinator` for multi-platform campaigns

**Need to REVIEW strategy?** → Always finish with critical review
- `@devils-advocate` for assumption challenges and blind spot identification

### 2. Example Requests

**Instagram Product Launch**:
```
@instagram-specialist "Create an Instagram Reel strategy for our eco-friendly water bottle launch. Target audience: 25-35, sustainability-focused. Goal: 50K reach, 500 link clicks."
```

**Multi-Platform Campaign**:
```
@social-media-coordinator "Launch our fitness app across Instagram and Facebook. 2-week campaign, $3K budget. Goal: 100K app downloads."
```

**Content Repurposing**:
```
@linkedin-specialist "I have a LinkedIn article on remote work (2,000 words). How do I adapt this for Instagram?"
```

**Critical Review**:
```
@devils-advocate "Review this social media strategy for blind spots, risks, and assumptions that may not hold."
```

### 3. Follow Quality Gates

Every strategy passes through three checkpoints:
1. **Platform Optimization** (Platform Specialist): Ensure content optimized for platform algorithm
2. **Brand Consistency** (Coordinator, if multi-platform): Maintain unified brand voice
3. **Critical Review** (Devil's Advocate): Challenge assumptions, identify blind spots, document concerns

**CRITICAL**: Always consult `@devils-advocate` before finalizing any strategy. This is mandatory quality gate.
