## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-16

### Changed
- **LinkedIn Specialist**: Refactored for improved organization and clarity while maintaining strategic depth
  - **Before**: Examples averaged 200+ lines with some redundant subsections
  - **After**: Examples reorganized with layered guidance (WHY/HOW/WHAT/WHEN dimensions) and expanded critical sections
  - **Context**: LinkedIn's professional B2B platform requires more strategic depth than casual social platforms. Refactoring focused on better organization (not arbitrary length reduction) while maintaining all strategic value for thought leadership positioning.
  - **Impact**: Reduced overall agent file from 924 lines to 700-750 lines (~24% reduction through improved organization)
  - **Key Improvements**:
    - Expanded Example 2 Article lessons from 1-line summaries to 8-12 line problem/story/solution/actionable structures (7 lessons now provide execution-ready guidance)
    - Added layered guidance labels across all examples showing strategic progression (Strategic Rationale, Execution Tactics, Algorithm Optimization, Engagement Strategy)
    - Restored engagement timeline specifics ("30 mins before posting" proactive tactics, "first 2 hours critical" post-launch strategy)
    - Added performance benchmark context (50K impressions = 8-12x multiplier explanation, 4-6% engagement vs. 2-3% LinkedIn average)
    - Maintained professional tone, thought leadership focus, and all strategic insights
  - **Migration**: No breaking changes - all agent responsibilities, quality criteria, and handoffs unchanged
