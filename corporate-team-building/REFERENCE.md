## Event Planning Principles

### Pacing and Energy Management

**Rule of 70/30**: 70% structured activities, 30% unstructured connection time
- **Structured time**: Organized activities with clear objectives and facilitation
- **Unstructured time**: Meals, breaks, travel between activities where organic bonding happens
- **Why**: Forced activities without breathing room create "forced fun" fatigue

**Energy Curve Consideration**:
- **Morning** (9am-12pm): High energy activities (physical challenges, collaborative problem-solving)
- **Afternoon** (1pm-4pm): Medium energy (workshops, skill-building, creative activities)
- **Evening** (5pm-8pm): Low energy (meals, reflection, social activities, networking)

**Buffer Time Formula**: Add 20% buffer to all time estimates
- 60-minute activity → Schedule 75 minutes
- Accounts for: Late starts, extended discussions, unexpected issues, group dynamics

### Group Size Dynamics

**Small Groups (5-12 people)**
- **Advantages**: Everyone participates equally, intimate conversations, high engagement
- **Activities**: Almost anything works, can do niche activities
- **Logistics**: Simple coordination, flexible venues
- **Considerations**: Absence of one person noticeable, need activities that scale down

**Medium Groups (13-30 people)**
- **Advantages**: Good energy, can split into breakout groups, most activities work
- **Activities**: Need breakout group strategies for participation balance
- **Logistics**: Moderate complexity, larger venues required
- **Considerations**: Stronger facilitation needed, may need multiple facilitators

**Large Groups (31-50+ people)**
- **Advantages**: High energy, can support premium experiences, creates organizational buzz
- **Activities**: Scalable formats only (not intimate workshops)
- **Logistics**: Complex (transportation, venue capacity, catering coordination)
- **Considerations**: Requires professional facilitation, limited venue options, plan far ahead (8-12 weeks)

### Activity Selection Criteria

**Bonding Potential vs Entertainment Value Matrix**:

| Bonding | Entertainment | Use Case | Examples |
|---------|---------------|----------|----------|
| High | High | **IDEAL** - Use these | Collaborative cooking, escape rooms, problem-solving challenges, service projects with team |
| High | Low | **ACCEPTABLE** - Can use | Facilitated workshops, trust-building exercises, team reflection sessions |
| Low | High | **AVOID** - Doesn't bond | Spectator events (sports games), concerts, passive entertainment |
| Low | Low | **NEVER** - Wastes time | Mandatory lectures, compliance training presented as "team building" |

**Accessibility Evaluation Checklist**:
- [ ] **Physical**: Alternatives available for low-mobility participants (no activity requires standing/walking for entire duration)
- [ ] **Dietary**: All restrictions accommodated (vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher, allergies)
- [ ] **Personality**: Introvert-friendly pacing (breaks provided, opt-out options for high-intensity social activities)
- [ ] **Financial**: No out-of-pocket costs for participants (company covers everything)
- [ ] **Cultural/Religious**: Sensitivity to diverse backgrounds (avoid alcohol-required events, religiously sensitive timing, culturally appropriate activities)
- [ ] **Language**: Accommodations for non-native speakers if applicable

### Logistics Planning Framework

**Booking Timeline (Work Backwards from Event Date)**:

- **6-8 weeks out**:
  - [ ] Secure primary venue (or reserve multiple if weather-dependent)
  - [ ] Book major activities requiring advance reservations (cooking classes, facilitators, venues)
  - [ ] Confirm facilitators or instructors

- **4-5 weeks out**:
  - [ ] Arrange transportation (if needed)
  - [ ] Book catering or restaurant reservations
  - [ ] Order materials or supplies for activities

- **2-3 weeks out**:
  - [ ] Final headcount confirmation
  - [ ] Dietary restriction collection and confirmation
  - [ ] Detailed logistics finalization (timing, roles, responsibilities)

- **1 week out**:
  - [ ] Send participant communications (schedule, logistics, what to bring)
  - [ ] Finalize contingency plans
  - [ ] Confirm all bookings and reservations
  - [ ] Prepare day-of materials (name tags, itineraries, emergency contacts)

**Contingency Planning Checklist**:

- **Weather contingencies** (for outdoor activities):
  - [ ] Indoor backup activity identified and can be booked on short notice
  - [ ] Weather monitoring plan (check 48 hours, 24 hours, morning of)
  - [ ] Cancellation/rescheduling policies understood for all bookings

- **Venue issues**:
  - [ ] Alternative venue identified (even if not formally reserved)
  - [ ] Venue has cancellation policy that protects company
  - [ ] Venue accessibility verified (visited in person or confirmed with photos)

- **Timing problems**:
  - [ ] Activities ranked by priority (must-do, nice-to-have, can-cut-if-needed)
  - [ ] 20% buffer time built into schedule
  - [ ] Flexible end time communicated to participants

- **Transportation delays**:
  - [ ] Buffer time between transportation and activities (30 minutes minimum)
  - [ ] Backup transportation contact (rideshare, additional vehicles)

- **Last-minute cancellations**:
  - [ ] Activities work with range of group sizes (can absorb 10-20% attrition)
  - [ ] Financial deposits or prepayments minimized where possible

## Team Bonding Mechanisms

### What Actually Creates Bonding

**1. Shared Challenges Requiring Interdependence**
- Activities where team members must rely on each other
- Examples: Escape rooms (need everyone's perspective), cooking classes (shared meal creation), service projects (collective impact)
- **Why it works**: Creates "we're in this together" mindset, builds trust through mutual reliance

**2. Conversation Time Without Agenda**
- Unstructured time at meals, during travel, on breaks
- Examples: Family-style dining (everyone shares dishes), walking between activities (natural conversations), coffee breaks
- **Why it works**: Organic connection, not forced sharing, people relax and open up

**3. Shared Meals with Family-Style Service**
- Everyone eating together from shared dishes (not individual plates)
- Examples: Large plates of food passed around, tapas/dim sum style, communal cooking
- **Why it works**: Sharing food is fundamental human bonding, family-style requires interaction

**4. Reflection or Debrief on Shared Experience**
- Structured time to discuss what was learned or experienced together
- Examples: Post-activity debrief ("what did we learn about how we work together?"), end-of-day reflection
- **Why it works**: Solidifies shared experience, extracts lessons, creates shared narrative

**5. Inside Jokes and Memorable Moments**
- Unexpected, funny, or challenging moments that become team stories
- Examples: Getting lost together, unexpected challenge in activity, funny mistake during cooking class
- **Why it works**: Shared memory creates emotional bond, story gets retold and reinforces connection

### What DOESN'T Create Bonding (Avoid These)

**1. Passive Spectating Together**
- Watching something as an audience without interaction
- Examples: Attending sports game, watching movie, going to concert
- **Why it fails**: No interdependence, limited conversation, could do alone

**2. Individual Activities Done in Parallel**
- Everyone doing the same thing but not interacting
- Examples: Spa day (everyone gets massage separately), individual craft project
- **Why it fails**: No collaboration, no shared challenge, surface-level interaction

**3. Forced Vulnerability Without Safety**
- Activities that require deep sharing before trust established
- Examples: "Tell the group your biggest weakness", trust falls on day one with new team
- **Why it fails**: Feels unsafe, creates resistance, damages trust instead of building it

**4. Competition Without Collaboration**
- Activities that pit team members against each other
- Examples: Winner-takes-all contests, individual performance competitions
- **Why it fails**: Creates rivalries, not bonds (competition works ONLY for already-bonded teams celebrating wins together)

## Team Types and Considerations

### Teams with Conflict or Low Morale

**Approach**: Build trust before vulnerability, neutral activities before deep work

**Recommended Activities**:
- Collaborative problem-solving (everyone working toward shared goal)
- Service projects (external focus takes pressure off internal dynamics)
- Creative workshops (cooking, art) where everyone is equally unskilled
- Low-stakes games requiring collaboration

**Avoid**:
- High competition (escalates existing tensions)
- Forced sharing about work issues (not ready for that vulnerability)
- Activities requiring established trust (trust falls, deep reflection)

**Facilitation Note**: May benefit from professional facilitator who can navigate group dynamics and surface issues constructively.

### New Teams or First-Time Meetings

**Approach**: Focus on icebreakers, learning about each other, low-stakes fun

**Recommended Activities**:
- Scavenger hunts (forces interaction, low-pressure)
- Cooking classes (equalizer, everyone is learning together)
- Team games (board games, trivia, light physical games)
- Discovery experiences (touring a new place together, shared novel experience)

**Avoid**:
- Activities requiring established relationships (inside jokes won't land)
- Activities requiring knowing each other's strengths/weaknesses (don't know yet)
- High-pressure collaborative challenges (anxiety without trust base)

### Remote Teams Meeting In Person

**Approach**: Balance structured activities with unstructured social time, make up for lost in-person connection

**Recommended Activities**:
- Mix of collaborative work and pure fun
- Touring shared location together (if teams in different cities)
- Longer meals with conversation time (remote teams need more social connection)
- Mix of working sessions and bonding activities

**Avoid**:
- All work/no play (defeats purpose of in-person meeting)
- All play/no work (missed opportunity for collaboration)
- Overly packed schedule (remote teams need downtime together)

## Dietary Accommodations Best Practices

### Common Dietary Restrictions

**Vegetarian**: No meat, poultry, fish
**Vegan**: No animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey)
**Halal**: Islamic dietary laws (no pork, alcohol; meat must be halal-certified)
**Kosher**: Jewish dietary laws (no pork, shellfish; meat and dairy separate; kosher-certified)
**Gluten-free**: No wheat, barley, rye (celiac disease or sensitivity)
**Allergies**: Common allergens (nuts, shellfish, dairy, eggs, soy)

### How to Handle Dietary Restrictions Properly

**1. Collect Information Early**:
- Ask in advance (at least 2-3 weeks before event)
- Use clear categories (vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher, gluten-free, allergies/other)
- Provide "other" option with free text for uncommon restrictions

**2. Communicate with Venues**:
- Provide complete dietary restriction list to caterers/restaurants
- Confirm accommodations in writing (not just verbal)
- Visit venue or request photos of how restrictions are accommodated (not just "we can handle it")

**3. Day-of Verification**:
- Label all food clearly (vegetarian, contains nuts, gluten-free, etc.)
- Have point person who knows dietary restrictions and can verify accommodations
- Check with individuals before they eat ("This is labeled vegetarian - is that what you need?")

**4. What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Assume "vegetarian option" works for everyone (vegans can't eat many vegetarian dishes)
- ❌ Offer only sides as "vegetarian option" (needs to be complete meal)
- ❌ Forget to ask about allergies (can be life-threatening)
- ❌ Collect restrictions but not share with venue (restrictions are useless if venue doesn't know)
- ❌ Make person with restriction feel awkward ("Sorry, we forgot about you")

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: "Forced Fun" Syndrome
**Problem**: Mandatory "fun" feels like obligation, creates resentment
**Solution**: 
- Frame as "team investment time" not "mandatory fun"
- Include opt-out options for high-intensity social activities
- Balance structured and unstructured time (Rule of 70/30)
- Choose activities team actually wants (survey preferences)

### Pitfall: Over-Scheduling
**Problem**: Cramming too much into timeline creates stress, defeats bonding purpose
**Solution**:
- Add 20% buffer time to all estimates
- Allow natural breaks (people need bathroom breaks, coffee, quiet time)
- Embrace "less is more" - better to do 3 things well than 6 things rushed
- Schedule flexibility (activities ranked by priority, can cut if needed)

### Pitfall: Accessibility Oversights
**Problem**: Activities exclude people with disabilities, dietary restrictions, personality differences
**Solution**:
- Run accessibility checklist for every activity
- Provide alternatives (physical activity has low-mobility option)
- Full dietary accommodation (not just "vegetarian option")
- Introvert-friendly pacing (breaks, quiet spaces, opt-out options)

### Pitfall: Budget Blindspots
**Problem**: Hidden costs or expenses beyond some participants' means
**Solution**:
- Company covers ALL costs (no out-of-pocket for participants)
- Budget includes: Transportation, activities, meals, materials, tips, everything
- Transparent cost estimate to stakeholders
- No financial barriers to participation

### Pitfall: Ignoring Existing Team Dynamics
**Problem**: Activity choice doesn't match team's reality (high competition for conflict-ridden team)
**Solution**:
- Profile team before planning (use team profiler agent)
- Match activities to team goals and dynamics
- For low-morale teams: Neutral activities before deep work
- For new teams: Icebreakers before collaboration
