# GitHub Copilot Agent Workflow Instructions

## Overview
This repository uses a multi-agent system to ensure high-quality software development. The workflow is orchestrated by the **Product Manager Agent**, who coordinates the **Full Stack Engineer**, **Code Reviewer**, and **QA Engineer**.

## Agents
- **Product Manager** (`product-manager.agent.md`): Orchestrates the lifecycle, plans features, and manages the team.
- **Full Stack Engineer** (`full-stack-engineer.agent.md`): Implements code with TDD and high standards.
- **Code Reviewer** (`code-reviewer.agent.md`): Reviews code for quality, security, and alignment.
- **QA Engineer** (`qa-engineer.agent.md`): Validates functionality and prevents regressions.

## Workflow Modes

### 1. FEATURE (Strict Mode)
Used for new functionality, architectural changes, or complex enhancements.
**Flow**: `PM (Plan)` -> `User Approval` -> `Engineer (Implement)` -> `Reviewer (Approve)` -> `QA (Verify)` -> `User Confirmation` -> `Commit`

### 2. BUG (Flexible Mode)
Used for bug fixes, minor adjustments, or simple tasks.
**Flow**: `PM (Triage)` -> `Engineer (Fix)` -> `Reviewer (Quick Check)` -> `QA (Verify)` -> `User Confirmation` -> `Commit`

## How to Use

1. **Start with the Product Manager**:
   Always begin a task by invoking the Product Manager agent.
   > "Hey @product-manager, I need to add a new feature to..."
   > "Hey @product-manager, there is a bug in..."

2. **Provide Clear Context**:
   - **Goal**: What are we trying to achieve?
   - **Constraints**: Any specific technologies or patterns?
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's done?

3. **Iterate**:
   - Review the plans generated by the PM.
   - Provide feedback during the "MANDATORY STOP" points.
   - If a review or QA step fails, the agents will iterate automatically, but your guidance helps.

## Best Practices
- **One Task at a Time**: Do not overload the session. Focus on one feature or bug fix.
- **Review Plans**: The `plans/` directory will contain the roadmap. Read it before approving.
- **TDD is Standard**: Expect tests to be written first.
- **Privacy First**: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed in logs or external calls.
