### Added
- **Initial Release**: Comprehensive philanthropic advisory system for evaluating initiatives targeting at-risk communities in Singapore
- **Six Specialized Agents**:
  - `philanthropic-strategy-advisor`: Hub coordinator for discovery, specialist routing, and synthesis
  - `initiative-evaluator`: Deep-dive assessment of program design, theory of change, evidence quality, and implementation feasibility
  - `impact-metrics-analyst`: Calculate SROI, CEA, and trajectory uplift metrics using quantitative methodologies
  - `scalability-assessor`: Evaluate growth potential, replication pathways, sustainability models, and organizational readiness
  - `portfolio-strategist`: Assess thematic fit, portfolio balance, concentration risk, and strategic alignment
  - `devils-advocate`: Critical review quality gate for bias detection, assumption challenging, and balanced perspective
- **Hub-and-Spoke Workflow**: Central coordinator routes to specialists as needed, synthesizes outputs, ensures coherent guidance
- **Impact Measurement Framework**: SROI (Social Return on Investment), CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis), trajectory uplift assessment
- **Singapore Focus**: Tailored to Singapore context, at-risk communities (families in crisis, children in lower-income families)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: copilot-instructions.md, README.md, individual agent files with examples
- **Quality Gates**: Discovery complete → Specialist analyses complete → Synthesis complete → Critical review complete

### Context
Built to provide systematic evaluation of philanthropic initiatives using quantitative metrics (SROI, CEA, trajectory uplift) with focus on Singapore at-risk communities and systemic change outcomes. Addresses user need for evidence-based funding decisions balancing program quality, financial efficiency, scalability, and portfolio strategy.

### Key Methodologies
- **SROI**: Measures social value created per dollar invested (ratio format)
- **CEA**: Measures cost per outcome unit achieved (benchmarking against similar programs)
- **Trajectory Uplift**: Long-term beneficiary outcome improvements vs. baseline (systemic change focus)

### Geographic and Thematic Scope
- **Geography**: Singapore exclusively
- **Populations**: Families facing crises not of their own making, children born into lower-income families
- **Outcomes**: Quantitative results leading to upstream systemic changes
- **Scale**: Singapore-focused initiatives (community to island-wide)
