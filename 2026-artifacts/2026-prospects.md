# 2026 Educational Program Prospects

This document evaluates two educational intervention programs targeting at-risk students in Singapore for potential implementation in 2026.

## Programs Under Evaluation

### Program 1: PSLE Foundational Math Intensive Care Programme

**Overview:**
Intensive mathematics intervention program for PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) students who are significantly behind grade-level in math fundamentals. This pilot program will be implemented at The Thought Treasure Knowledge Centre (TTKC) with the goal of creating a replicable syllabus model that can be scaled nationwide.

**Target Population:**
- Primary 5 and 6 students preparing for PSLE
- Students who are 2+ years behind grade-level in mathematics fundamentals
- Focus on students from lower-income families (<$3,000/month household income)
- Estimated initial cohort: 30-50 students

**Program Design:**
- Duration: 18-month intensive program (P5 start through PSLE completion)
- Frequency: 3 sessions per week, 2 hours per session
- Small group instruction: 5-6 students per instructor
- Curriculum: Foundational skills focus (number sense, basic operations, problem-solving frameworks)
- Progress tracking: Monthly assessments with individualized learning plans
- Parent engagement: Bi-weekly progress updates and home practice support

**Theory of Change:**
Students far behind in math fundamentals → Intensive small-group instruction with proven pedagogy → Master foundational concepts → Build confidence and learning mindset → Improved PSLE math scores → Better secondary school placement → Improved long-term educational and economic outcomes

**Intervention Logic:**
1. Diagnostic assessment identifies specific skill gaps
2. Customized learning pathway addresses foundational weaknesses
3. High-frequency, small-group instruction ensures personalized attention
4. Regular progress monitoring enables rapid adjustment
5. Parent engagement reinforces learning at home
6. Confidence building reduces math anxiety and learned helplessness

**Budget Estimate:**
- Program cost: $250,000 per year (18-month pilot = $375,000)
- Cost per beneficiary: $7,500-12,500 per student (depending on cohort size)
- Breakdown:
  - Instructor costs (specialized teachers): $150,000
  - Curriculum development: $50,000
  - Materials and resources: $25,000
  - Assessment tools: $15,000
  - Parent engagement programs: $10,000
  - Administrative overhead: $50,000
  - Facilities (TTKC space): $25,000

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Short-term: 80% of students show measurable improvement in foundational math skills (standardized assessment gains)
- Medium-term: 60% of students achieve passing PSLE math scores (vs 20% baseline expectation)
- Long-term: Improved secondary school placement, reduced dropout rates

**Replication Model:**
- Document curriculum framework and teaching methodology
- Create instructor training program
- Develop assessment and progress tracking tools
- Publish implementation guide for other centers
- Target: 5-10 centers adopting model within 3 years

**Singapore Context:**
- PSLE is critical educational gateway determining secondary school placement
- Math scores are particularly predictive of academic trajectory
- Existing tuition centers focus on high-achievers, leaving behind struggling students
- Government programs (LSM - Learning Support for Mathematics) typically end at P4, leaving P5-P6 gap
- TTKC has established relationships with lower-income families and community trust

### Program 2: 13+ CampusImpact Post-Primary Intervention Programme

**Overview:**
Post-primary school engagement program for at-risk youth (ages 13+) who have completed primary education but face barriers to successful secondary education integration. This program aims to maintain engagement, build life skills, and prevent dropout through CampusImpact platform and community partnerships.

**Target Population:**
- Students aged 13-16 (Secondary 1-4 age range)
- Youth from lower-income families who completed primary school
- Students at risk of secondary school dropout
- Youth struggling with social-emotional challenges or family instability
- Estimated initial cohort: 40-60 students

**Program Design (Draft - Seeking Input):**
- Duration: Ongoing relationship model (minimum 2-year engagement)
- Engagement models being considered:
  1. **Academic Support Track**: Homework help, exam prep, subject tutoring
  2. **Skills Development Track**: Life skills, vocational exploration, digital literacy
  3. **Mentorship Track**: 1-on-1 mentoring with volunteer professionals
  4. **Community Service Track**: Service learning projects building purpose and connection
  5. **Hybrid Model**: Combination approach based on individual needs

**Key Questions (Input Needed):**
- What engagement model is most effective for this age group and risk profile?
- How to maintain sustained engagement when formal academic pressure is less immediate?
- What role can technology (apps, online platforms) play vs in-person connection?
- How to coordinate with schools vs operate independently?
- What incentive structures work without creating dependency?

**Theory of Change (Preliminary):**
At-risk youth post-primary → Sustained engagement through relevant programming → Build resilience, skills, and support network → Stay in school → Complete secondary education → Improved employment and life outcomes

**Potential Intervention Components:**
1. **CampusImpact Platform Integration**: Digital engagement, progress tracking, resource access
2. **Mentorship Pairing**: Adult mentors providing guidance and support
3. **Skills Workshops**: Monthly workshops on practical life skills (financial literacy, communication, problem-solving)
4. **Academic Support**: Homework clubs, study groups, subject tutoring (if needed)
5. **Career Exploration**: Job shadowing, vocational tasters, industry visits
6. **Community Building**: Youth leadership opportunities, peer support groups

**Budget Estimate (Preliminary):**
- Program cost: $180,000 per year
- Cost per beneficiary: $3,000-4,500 per student per year
- Breakdown:
  - Program coordinators: $80,000
  - Mentor recruitment and training: $25,000
  - Workshop facilitators: $20,000
  - CampusImpact platform costs: $15,000
  - Activities and materials: $15,000
  - Transportation support: $10,000
  - Administrative overhead: $15,000

**Expected Outcomes (To Be Refined):**
- Short-term: 85% program retention rate, 75% regular attendance
- Medium-term: 70% secondary school completion rate (vs 50% baseline estimate)
- Long-term: Higher employment rates, reduced youth crime involvement

**Key Challenges:**
- Sustaining engagement during adolescence (competing priorities, peer pressure)
- Measuring impact when causation is harder to establish than earlier interventions
- Coordination with families, schools, and other youth services
- Balancing structure with youth autonomy and choice
- Program design uncertainty - need evidence-based approach

**Singapore Context:**
- Secondary school dropout concentrated in lower-income families
- Government programs focus on academic support (after-school care, tuition subsidies)
- Gap in holistic youth development and mentorship for at-risk teens
- CampusImpact has track record with community engagement programs
- Need to coordinate with Ministry of Education, MSF youth programs, and community partners
