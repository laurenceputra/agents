# 2026 Educational Program Prospects

This document evaluates two educational intervention programs targeting at-risk students in Singapore for potential implementation in 2026.

## Programs Under Evaluation

### Program 1: PSLE Foundational Math Intensive Care Programme

**Overview:**
Intensive mathematics intervention program for PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) students who are significantly behind grade-level in math fundamentals. This pilot program will be implemented at The Thought Treasure Knowledge Centre (TTKC) with the goal of creating a replicable syllabus model that can be scaled nationwide.

**Target Population:**
- Primary 5 and 6 students preparing for PSLE
- Students who are 2+ years behind grade-level in mathematics fundamentals
- Focus on students from lower-income families (<$3,000/month household income)
- Estimated initial cohort: 30-50 students

**Program Design:**
- Duration: 18-month intensive program (P5 start through PSLE completion)
- Frequency: 3 sessions per week, 2 hours per session
- Small group instruction: 5-6 students per instructor
- Curriculum: Foundational skills focus (number sense, basic operations, problem-solving frameworks)
- Progress tracking: Monthly assessments with individualized learning plans
- Parent engagement: Bi-weekly progress updates and home practice support

**Theory of Change:**
Students far behind in math fundamentals → Intensive small-group instruction with proven pedagogy → Master foundational concepts → Build confidence and learning mindset → Improved PSLE math scores → Better secondary school placement → Improved long-term educational and economic outcomes

**Intervention Logic:**
1. Diagnostic assessment identifies specific skill gaps
2. Customized learning pathway addresses foundational weaknesses
3. High-frequency, small-group instruction ensures personalized attention
4. Regular progress monitoring enables rapid adjustment
5. Parent engagement reinforces learning at home
6. Confidence building reduces math anxiety and learned helplessness

**Budget Estimate:**
- Program cost: $250,000 per year (18-month pilot = $375,000)
- Cost per beneficiary: $7,500-12,500 per student (depending on cohort size)
- Breakdown:
  - Instructor costs (specialized teachers): $150,000
  - Curriculum development: $50,000
  - Materials and resources: $25,000
  - Assessment tools: $15,000
  - Parent engagement programs: $10,000

- Mitigation: International evidence from similar intensive math interventions shows 0.3-0.5 standard deviation gains

### Systemic Impact Assessment

**Impact Type: Primarily UPSTREAM (Moderate-High Systemic Potential)**

**Systemic Impact Score: 7/10**

**Rationale:**
1. **Root Cause Addressing (HIGH)**: Targets foundational skill gaps at critical juncture, prevents cascading disadvantage
2. **Leverage Point (HIGH)**: PSLE is key gateway; math proficiency unlocks educational pathways
3. **Replication Potential (HIGH)**: Designed for scalability with curriculum framework and training model
4. **Systems Change Potential (MODERATE)**: Fills gap in government programs, potential to influence education policy
5. **Prevention vs Treatment (HIGH)**: Prevents educational failure before it becomes entrenched

**Systemic Impact Mechanisms:**
- **Direct**: Students gain foundational skills → better educational trajectory → economic mobility
- **Family**: Parents gain confidence in supporting children's education, model for younger siblings
- **Community**: TTKC demonstrates effective model → Other centers adopt → Nationwide reach
- **Systems**: Identifies P5-P6 gap in government LSM program → Potential policy influence to extend support

**Scale Potential:**
- Target: 5-10 centers within 3 years
- Potential reach: 150-500 students annually at scale (conservative)
- If adopted as MOE co-funded program: 1,000-2,000 students annually nationwide

**Limitations:**
- Intervention at P5-P6 is later than ideal (P1-P3 intervention more cost-effective)
- Does not address upstream factors (family poverty, parent education, early childhood development)
- Replication requires specialized instructors and quality control

### Data Quality and Measurement Gaps

**Current Data Quality: LOW (pilot program, estimates only)**

**Strengths:**
- Clear theory of change based on established educational research
- Measurable short-term outcomes (assessment scores, PSLE results)
- Built-in progress tracking (monthly assessments)

**Critical Measurement Gaps:**
1. **Baseline Data**: Need diagnostic assessment of actual skill gaps and learning profiles
2. **Comparison Group**: Historical data is weak comparator; need matched control group
3. **Attribution**: Difficult to isolate program effect from other factors (family changes, school quality, peer effects)
4. **Long-term Tracking**: No plan for tracking beyond PSLE (secondary placement, completion rates)
5. **Cost Data**: Budget estimates need validation against actual pilot costs
6. **Replication Metrics**: No framework yet for measuring replication quality and fidelity

**Required Data Collection:**
- Pre/post standardized math assessments (validated instruments)
- Monthly progress tracking (item-level skill mastery)
- PSLE outcomes with matched comparison group
- Student/parent surveys (confidence, self-efficacy, engagement)
- Instructor fidelity checks (curriculum adherence)
- Cost accounting (actual vs estimated)
- 3-year follow-up: Secondary school placement, Year 1 math performance
- 5-year follow-up: Secondary completion rates

**Data Rigor Recommendation:**
- Partner with NIE (National Institute of Education) or SMU for evaluation design
- Implement randomized waitlist control if ethical and feasible
- Minimum: matched comparison group with pre-program equivalence checks

### Singapore Context Fit Assessment

**Context Fit Score: 9/10 (Excellent)**

**Alignment Strengths:**
1. **Policy Gap**: Directly addresses P5-P6 gap in government LSM program (which ends at P4)
2. **Critical Gateway**: PSLE remains high-stakes educational transition in Singapore
3. **Target Population**: Lower-income families are underserved by existing tuition market
4. **Community Trust**: TTKC has established relationships with target population
5. **Replication Infrastructure**: Singapore's dense nonprofit network enables scaling
6. **Evidence Culture**: Singapore education system values data-driven interventions

**Singapore-Specific Considerations:**
- **Tuition Culture**: Must differentiate from commercial tuition (holistic support vs exam drilling)
- **Government Coordination**: Need MOE awareness/endorsement for school coordination and data access
- **Ethnic/Language Diversity**: Curriculum must work across Tamil/Malay/Chinese-medium students
- **High-Stakes Context**: PSLE pressure can be double-edged (motivation vs anxiety)

**Complementarity with Existing Programs:**
- **Government**: Fills gap between LSM (P1-P4) and secondary intervention programs
- **Nonprofit**: Aligns with MENDAKI, CDAC, SINDA support for academic achievement
- **Commercial**: Serves population unable to afford or access private tuition

**Potential Barriers:**
- Stigma around remedial education (need positive framing)
- Parent buy-in for intensive time commitment
- Coordination with schools for student identification and progress sharing

### Key Risks and Assumptions

**Critical Assumptions:**
1. **Instructional Quality**: Assumes specialized instructors with expertise in remedial math pedagogy (HIGH RISK if not achieved)
2. **Student Attendance**: Assumes 85%+ attendance rate (MODERATE RISK - family instability, competing priorities)
3. **Parent Engagement**: Assumes bi-weekly parent involvement (MODERATE RISK - working parents, language barriers)
4. **Replication Fidelity**: Assumes curriculum can be documented and transferred effectively (MODERATE RISK)
5. **Comparison Group Validity**: Assumes historical data is adequate comparator (HIGH RISK - weak causal inference)

**Key Risks:**
1. **Instructor Recruitment**: Specialized remedial math teachers are scarce (MITIGATION: partner with NIE for training pipeline)
2. **Student Selection Bias**: Self-selection could skew results (MITIGATION: randomized waitlist if oversubscribed)
3. **Sustainability**: Unclear long-term funding model beyond pilot (MITIGATION: build replication case for institutional funders)
4. **Scalability**: Quality control during rapid replication (MITIGATION: rigorous training and certification program)
5. **Measurement**: Weak evaluation design limits evidence base (MITIGATION: partner with research institution)

### Confidence Level Rating

**Overall Confidence: MEDIUM (65%)**

**Factors Increasing Confidence:**
- Strong theoretical foundation (math proficiency highly predictive)
- Clear intervention logic (intensive, small-group, foundational focus)
- Critical leverage point (PSLE gateway, P5-P6 gap)
- Proven pedagogy (small-group instruction, mastery-based learning)
- Replication intent from start (increases potential scale)

**Factors Decreasing Confidence:**
- Pilot program (no prior implementation data)
- Population-specific challenges (severe learning gaps, family instability)
- Weak evaluation design (no comparison group yet)
- Cost uncertainty (budget estimates not validated)
- Replication assumptions (quality control during scale-up unclear)

### Comparable Programs (Singapore Context)

**Similar Initiatives:**
1. **Government LSM (Learning Support for Mathematics)**: P1-P4 intervention, similar small-group model, ~70% achieve grade-level proficiency
2. **MENDAKI Tuition Scheme**: Academic support for Malay students, community-based, less intensive
3. **Breakthrough Programme (Yale-NUS/NUS)**: Mentorship + academic support for lower-income students, secondary level
4. **KidSTART**: Early childhood intervention, shows positive results but different age group

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Age/Stage**: Only program targeting P5-P6 severe learning gaps specifically
- **Intensity**: More intensive than typical tuition schemes (6 hours/week vs 2-3 hours)
- **Replication Model**: Explicit design for scalability from inception

### Executive Summary
- **Program**: CampusImpact 13+ Post-Primary Engagement
- **Target Population**: 40-60 at-risk youth ages 13-16, lower-income families
- **Total Investment**: $180,000 per year
- **Cost per Beneficiary**: $3,000-$4,500 per year
- **Estimated SROI**: 2.5:1 to 3.8:1 (highly uncertain due to program design uncertainty)
- **Confidence Level**: LOW (35%) - significant program design uncertainty, weaker causal chain, limited comparable data
- **Recommendation**: DEFER funding until program model is better defined; fund pilot design phase instead

### SROI Analysis

**Monetized Outcomes (per student, 20-year horizon):**

1. **Secondary School Completion** ($20,000-35,000 per student)
   - Baseline: 50% expected completion rate for at-risk youth
   - Target: 70% completion rate (20 percentage point uplift)
   - Secondary completion adds ~$100,000-$175,000 lifetime earnings
   - Attributed value (20% × avg × 60% attribution): $20,000-$35,000

2. **Reduced Youth Crime/Delinquency** ($5,000-$10,000 per student)
   - Mentorship and engagement reduce risky behavior
   - Assumption: 10-15% reduction in juvenile justice involvement
   - Cost savings to society + individual outcomes: $5,000-$10,000

3. **Improved Employment Outcomes** ($8,000-$15,000 per student)
   - Career exploration and skills development → Better employment
   - Assumption: 10% increase in employment rate, 5% wage premium
   - Present value: $8,000-$15,000

4. **Social-Emotional Wellbeing** ($4,000-$8,000 per student)
   - Mentorship, peer support, sense of belonging
   - Reduced mental health issues, improved life satisfaction
   - Estimated value from youth development literature: $4,000-$8,000

**Total Monetized Value**: $37,000-$68,000 per student (wide range due to uncertainty)

**SROI Calculation:**
- Investment: $3,000-$4,500 per student per year × 2 years avg engagement = $6,000-$9,000
- Returns: $37,000-$68,000 per student
- **SROI Ratio: 2.5:1 to 3.8:1** (every $1 invested returns $2.50-$3.80 in social value)

**CRITICAL CAUTION**: SROI highly uncertain due to:
- Weak causal chain (many confounding factors in adolescence)
- Program design undefined (which activities actually drive outcomes?)
- Attribution challenges (schools, families, peers, government programs all influence)
- Self-selection bias (engaged youth may be more likely to succeed regardless)

**Key Assumptions (all HIGH UNCERTAINTY):**
- Attribution: 60% (lower than Program 1 due to many confounding factors)
- Deadweight: 25% (many youth would complete secondary school without program)
- Drop-off: 30% over 20 years (adolescent interventions show higher fade-out)
- Engagement: Assumes 2-year average engagement, but model unclear

### CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)

**Primary Outcome Metric: Secondary school completion**

- Baseline expectation (without intervention): 50% completion rate
- Target outcome (with intervention): 70% completion rate
- Uplift: 20 percentage points

**Cost per Outcome Achieved:**
- Cohort size: 50 students (midpoint estimate)
- Expected additional completers: 10 students (20% × 50)
- Annual program cost: $180,000 × 2 years = $360,000 (2-year engagement assumption)
- **Cost per additional student completing secondary school: $36,000**

**Benchmark Comparison:**
- Government youth programs (e.g., MOE after-school care): ~$2,000-$4,000 per student annually (less intensive, universal access)
- Mentor-focused programs (e.g., Big Brothers Big Sisters Singapore): ~$3,000-$5,000 per student annually (mentorship only)
- Comprehensive youth development programs: $25,000-$40,000 per significant outcome (comparable intensity)
- **Assessment**: Cost per outcome is within range for comprehensive youth programs, but causation much weaker than early intervention

**CRITICAL CONCERN**: Cost-effectiveness highly dependent on which program model is adopted. Academic support track likely cheaper but less impactful; mentorship + skills development more expensive but potentially more effective.

**Secondary Outcome Metrics:**
- Cost per student retained in program for 1+ year: $4,200 (42 students expected, 85% target)
- Cost per student with regular attendance (75%+): $4,800 (37 students expected, 75% target)

### Trajectory Uplift Analysis

**Baseline Trajectory (without intervention):**
- Age 13-16: Struggling in secondary school, low engagement (50% dropout risk)
- Age 18: 50% do not complete O-Levels, direct workforce entry
- Age 25: Low-wage employment or unemployment ($22,000/year median)
- Lifetime earnings: ~$700,000-$900,000
- Social outcomes: Higher risk of youth crime, mental health challenges, family instability

**Intervention Trajectory (with program):**
- Age 13-16: Sustained engagement through program, mentorship and skills support
- Age 18: 70% complete O-Levels (20 percentage point improvement)
- Age 25: Mid-wage employment ($28,000/year median)
- Lifetime earnings: ~$900,000-$1,200,000
- Social outcomes: Reduced risk behaviors, improved wellbeing, stronger social networks

**Trajectory Uplift:**
- **Educational Trajectory**: 20 percentage point improvement in secondary completion
- **Economic Trajectory**: $200,000-$300,000 additional lifetime earnings (median, highly uncertain)
- **Social Trajectory**: Reduced likelihood of involvement in justice system, improved mental health

**Confidence in Uplift Projections: LOW**

**Concerns:**
- Weak evidence base for specific program model (undefined)
- Adolescent interventions typically show smaller and more variable effects than early childhood
- Attribution extremely difficult (schools, families, peers, biology, policy all influence)
- Self-selection likely (engaged youth may differ from non-engaged in unmeasured ways)
- Comparison group identification challenging (matched controls difficult to find)

### Systemic Impact Assessment

**Impact Type: MIXED (DOWNSTREAM + Some UPSTREAM)**

**Systemic Impact Score: 5/10 (Moderate)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Root Cause Addressing (MODERATE)**: Addresses symptoms (dropout risk) more than root causes (poverty, family instability, early skill gaps)
2. **Leverage Point (MODERATE)**: Secondary completion important but later than early education interventions
3. **Replication Potential (MODERATE-LOW)**: Model undefined makes replication framework unclear
4. **Systems Change Potential (MODERATE)**: Could demonstrate holistic youth model, but many similar programs already exist
5. **Prevention vs Treatment (MIXED)**: Prevents dropout but doesn't address upstream factors that created risk in first place

**Systemic Impact Mechanisms:**
- **Direct**: Youth stay engaged → Complete secondary → Better employment outcomes
- **Family**: Positive youth development may benefit younger siblings, reduce family stress
- **Community**: CampusImpact platform could scale if model proven effective
- **Systems**: Limited systems change potential (similar programs already exist in Singapore)

**Scale Potential:**
- CampusImpact platform could theoretically reach many youth
- But: Effective youth programs are relationship-intensive, hard to scale without quality dilution
- Realistic scale: 200-400 youth annually if model proven effective (5-10× current proposal)

**Limitations:**
- Intervention at age 13-16 is late (early childhood or primary school more cost-effective)
- Does NOT address root causes: family poverty, parent education, early trauma, learning gaps
- Crowded space: Many youth programs exist, marginal impact of one more program unclear
- Relationship-dependent: Quality relies heavily on mentors, coordinators (hard to standardize)

### Data Quality and Measurement Gaps

**Current Data Quality: VERY LOW (conceptual program only)**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **No Program Model**: Multiple tracks proposed but no decision on which to implement
2. **No Theory of Change**: Unclear which specific activities drive which specific outcomes
3. **No Baseline Data**: Don't know actual characteristics of target youth or current outcomes
4. **No Comparison Strategy**: Extremely difficult to find matched comparison group for at-risk youth
5. **Attribution Nightmare**: Schools, families, peers, government programs, biology all confounding factors
6. **Self-Selection**: Engaged youth differ systematically from non-engaged youth

**Required Data Collection (IF PROGRAM PROCEEDS):**
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Academic records, risk factors, social-emotional status, family context
2. **Engagement Tracking**: Attendance, program participation, activity completion
3. **Outcome Tracking**: Academic performance, school enrollment status, behavioral indicators
4. **Longitudinal Follow-up**: Track 3-5 years post-program (secondary completion, employment)
5. **Process Evaluation**: Which activities did youth find valuable? What drove engagement?
6. **Comparison Group**: Matched youth not in program (very challenging to identify and track)

**Data Rigor Challenges:**
- Comparison group nearly impossible without random assignment (waitlist design?)
- Long follow-up period needed (outcomes manifest years later)
- High attrition likely (at-risk youth mobile, contact information changes)
- Self-report bias (youth may over-report positive outcomes)
- Attribution weak even with comparison group (too many confounding factors)

### Singapore Context Fit Assessment

**Context Fit Score: 6/10 (Moderate)**

**Alignment Strengths:**
1. **Real Need**: Secondary dropout concentrated in lower-income families
2. **Service Gap**: Holistic youth development programs less common than academic support
3. **CampusImpact Platform**: Existing infrastructure and community presence
4. **Age-Appropriate**: Targets post-primary transition when risk escalates

**Concerns:**
1. **Crowded Space**: Many youth programs already exist (MOE after-school, CDC programs, NCSS agencies)
2. **Unclear Differentiation**: What does this program offer that others don't?
3. **Program Model Undefined**: Hard to assess Singapore fit when design unclear
4. **Government Coordination**: Requires strong partnerships with MOE, schools, MSF - not addressed
5. **Sustainability**: How does this differ from existing government-funded youth services?

**Singapore-Specific Considerations:**
- **Academic Pressure**: Singapore system high-stakes; need to balance academic support vs holistic development
- **National Service**: Males age 18+ enter NS, complicates longitudinal engagement and tracking
- **Ethnic Diversity**: Program must work across different cultural communities
- **Government Services**: Extensive existing youth services through MOE, MSF, CDCs - need clear value-add
- **Parental Expectations**: Parent buy-in critical but may prioritize academic results over holistic development

**Potential Complementarity:**
- Could fill gap between MOE academic programs and MSF crisis intervention
- Holistic youth development focus (mentorship, skills, purpose) less common
- Technology platform (CampusImpact) could enable efficient coordination

**Potential Overlap:**
- MOE: After-school care, student support programs, school counseling
- MSF: Youth intervention programs, family services
- CDC: Youth programs and community engagement
- NCSS: 500+ social service agencies, many serving youth

### Key Risks and Assumptions

**CRITICAL PROGRAM DESIGN RISK: NO DEFINED MODEL**

This is the PRIMARY risk. The program proposes five possible engagement models but hasn't chosen which to implement. This makes evaluation, budgeting, and planning highly speculative.

**Other Critical Assumptions:**
1. **Engagement Model**: Assumes hybrid model can sustain engagement (VERY HIGH RISK - no evidence which model works)
2. **Retention**: Assumes 85% one-year retention (HIGH RISK - adolescents have competing priorities, peer pressure)
3. **Attendance**: Assumes 75% regular attendance (HIGH RISK - family obligations, school conflicts, motivation challenges)
4. **Mentor Quality**: Assumes volunteers effective without extensive training (HIGH RISK)
5. **Attribution**: Assumes program drives 60% of outcome improvement (HIGH RISK - weak causal chain)
6. **CampusImpact Platform**: Assumes technology enhances engagement (MODERATE RISK - could be barrier for some youth)

**Key Risks:**
1. **Model Selection**: Wrong model choice → Low engagement → Program failure (CRITICAL)
2. **Sustained Engagement**: Youth drop out after initial novelty wears off (HIGH)
3. **Measurement**: Can't prove impact even if program effective (HIGH)
4. **Coordination**: Poor coordination with schools/families limits effectiveness (HIGH)
5. **Mentor Recruitment**: Can't find/retain quality volunteer mentors (MODERATE)
6. **Funding Sustainability**: Unclear long-term funding model (MODERATE)
7. **Scope Creep**: Try to do too much (academic + skills + mentorship + service) and do nothing well (MODERATE)

### Confidence Level Rating

**Overall Confidence: LOW (35%)**

**This is among the lowest confidence ratings for a philanthropic program evaluation.**

**Factors Decreasing Confidence:**
- **No defined program model** (CRITICAL)
- Weak causal chain (adolescent outcomes influenced by too many factors)
- No baseline data or pilot experience
- Attribution challenges nearly insurmountable without RCT
- Crowded programmatic space with unclear differentiation
- Late-stage intervention (less cost-effective than early childhood or primary)
- Measurement challenges extreme

**Factors Increasing Confidence:**
- Real identified need (secondary dropout among at-risk youth)
- CampusImpact has existing platform and community presence
- Mentorship and youth development have evidence base (though variable effectiveness)
- Lower cost per student than Program 1

**Overall**: Too many unknowns to recommend funding at this stage.

### Comparable Programs (Singapore Context)

**Government Programs:**
1. **MOE After-School Care**: Academic support, social activities, ~$2-4k per student
2. **MOE Student Support**: Counseling, mentorship, intervention for at-risk students (free)
3. **Youth Intervention Programs (MSF)**: Case management for high-risk youth

**Nonprofit Programs:**
1. **SHINE Children and Youth Services**: Holistic youth development, mentorship, life skills
2. ***SCAPE**: Youth programming, leadership development, creative arts
3. **Boys' Brigade / Girls' Brigade**: Character development, mentorship, structured activities
4. **Youth Corps Singapore**: Service learning and youth leadership

**Evidence from Comparable Programs:**
- Mentorship programs: 0.1-0.3 SD improvement in outcomes (modest effects)
- Youth development programs: Variable effectiveness, relationship quality matters most
- Academic support: Clearer outcomes but may not address root causes
- Hybrid models: Some evidence of effectiveness but implementation-intensive

**Key Differentiators (IF MODEL DEFINED):**
- CampusImpact platform integration (technology + in-person)
- Focus on post-primary transition specifically
- Potential for data-driven approach to engagement

**Concern**: Unclear how this program differs meaningfully from existing offerings.

### Overall Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION: DEFER FUNDING - FUND PROGRAM DESIGN PHASE INSTEAD**

**Proposed Alternative: $30,000 for 6-month program design and pilot planning**

**Rationale for Deferral:**
- **Too many unknowns**: No defined program model makes evaluation purely speculative
- **Weak theory of change**: Unclear which specific activities drive which specific outcomes
- **Measurement challenges**: Attribution nearly impossible without rigorous design
- **Crowded space**: Need clear differentiation from existing programs
- **Low confidence**: 35% confidence insufficient for $180,000 annual commitment

**Proposed Program Design Phase (6 months, $30,000):**

1. **Evidence Review** ($5,000)
   - Systematic review of effective adolescent intervention models
   - Identify which program components have strongest evidence base
   - Analyze comparable programs in Singapore context

2. **Stakeholder Consultation** ($5,000)
   - Interview youth, parents, teachers, school counselors, existing program staff
   - Understand what gaps exist in current services
   - Identify what youth actually want/need (not just what adults think they need)

3. **Program Model Selection** ($10,000)
   - Choose specific engagement model based on evidence + stakeholder input
   - Develop detailed theory of change (activities → outputs → outcomes)
   - Design engagement strategy with retention mechanisms
   - Create detailed curriculum/activity plans

4. **Evaluation Design** ($5,000)
   - Partner with research institution (SMU, NUS, NIE)
   - Design rigorous evaluation (randomized waitlist if possible)
   - Identify comparison group strategy
   - Create measurement framework and data collection tools

5. **Pilot Planning** ($5,000)
   - Detailed budget for 12-month pilot with 20-30 youth
   - Mentor recruitment and training plan
   - School/family coordination strategy
   - Partnership agreements with MOE, schools, other agencies

**Decision Point After Design Phase:**
- If program model clear, theory of change strong, evaluation rigorous → Fund 12-month pilot ($80,000-$100,000)
- If design phase reveals program not differentiated or not feasible → Do not proceed

**Why This Approach:**
- De-risks investment (spend $30k to save $180k if program not viable)
- Ensures program design based on evidence and stakeholder input (not assumptions)
- Creates rigorous evaluation framework from start
- Identifies true differentiation from existing programs
- Engages youth voice in design (critical for this age group)

**If Stakeholder Insists on Immediate Funding Despite Risks:**
- Reduce to 12-month pilot at $90,000 (half scale, 25 students)
- REQUIRE program model selection in month 1
- REQUIRE partnership with research institution for evaluation
- Clear go/no-go decision at 6 months based on retention/engagement metrics

## Comparative Analysis: Program 1 vs Program 2

### Summary Table

| Dimension | Program 1 (PSLE Math) | Program 2 (13+ Engagement) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **SROI** | 3.2:1 to 4.1:1 | 2.5:1 to 3.8:1 (uncertain) |
| **Cost per Outcome** | $23,400 per PSLE passer | $36,000 per secondary completer |
| **Systemic Impact** | 7/10 (High) | 5/10 (Moderate) |
| **Confidence Level** | 65% (Medium) | 35% (Low) |
| **Program Readiness** | Ready for pilot | Model undefined |
| **Measurement Quality** | Moderate (clear outcomes) | Low (attribution weak) |
| **Replication Potential** | High (designed for scale) | Moderate (relationship-intensive) |
| **Singapore Context Fit** | 9/10 (Excellent) | 6/10 (Moderate) |
| **Recommendation** | FUND with conditions | DEFER, fund design phase |

### Key Insights

**Program 1 Strengths:**
- Clear intervention logic and strong theory of change
- Addresses identified gap in Singapore education landscape (P5-P6)
- Higher systemic impact potential through replication
- Measurable outcomes at critical juncture (PSLE)
- Evidence-based pedagogy (small-group, intensive, mastery-based)

**Program 1 Challenges:**
- Higher cost per outcome than early intervention
- Late-stage intervention (P5-P6 vs P1-P3)
- Requires specialized instructors (scarce resource)
- Pilot uncertainty (no prior data)
- Needs rigorous evaluation design

**Program 2 Strengths:**
- Lower cost per student per year
- Addresses real need (secondary dropout among at-risk youth)
- CampusImpact has existing infrastructure
- Holistic approach could address multiple risk factors

**Program 2 Challenges:**
- No defined program model (CRITICAL)
- Weak causal chain (many confounding factors)
- Crowded programmatic space (unclear differentiation)
- Measurement nearly impossible without RCT
- Later-stage intervention (less cost-effective)
- Low confidence (35%) insufficient for funding

### Strategic Recommendation

**PRIORITIZE PROGRAM 1, DEFER PROGRAM 2**

**Recommended Investment:**
1. **Immediate**: Fund Program 1 pilot at $375,000 (18 months) with conditions listed above
2. **Design Phase**: Fund Program 2 design phase at $30,000 (6 months)
3. **Future Decision**: Re-evaluate Program 2 after design phase complete

**Rationale:**
- Program 1 is ready, Program 2 is not
- Program 1 has higher confidence, clearer theory of change, better systemic impact potential
- Program 2 needs foundational design work before funding justifiable
- Sequencing allows learning: If Program 1 successful, can apply lessons to Program 2
- Risk management: Don't invest in undefined program when clear opportunity exists

**If Budget Allows Both:**
- Fund Program 1 at full pilot scale ($375k)
- Fund Program 2 design phase ($30k)
- Total: $405k investment with clear go/no-go decision points

**If Budget Only Allows One:**
- Fund Program 1 only
- Recommend seeking separate funding for Program 2 design phase from youth-focused funder

## Evaluation Methodology Notes

**Analysis Framework:**
- SROI calculations based on 20-year horizon with 3% discount rate
- CEA focused on primary outcomes (PSLE passing, secondary completion)
- Trajectory uplift used Singapore-specific wage and education data
- Systemic impact assessed using upstream/downstream framework
- Confidence ratings based on evidence strength, measurement feasibility, causal attribution

**Singapore Context:**
- Demographics: Ministry of Statistics data (2023)
- Wage data: MOM (Ministry of Manpower) median wages by education level
- Education outcomes: MOE data on PSLE, secondary completion rates
- Comparable programs: NCSS directory, government program listings

**Limitations of This Evaluation:**
- Program 1 estimates based on similar program evidence (no pilot data yet)
- Program 2 highly speculative due to undefined model
- SROI monetization involves value judgments (social value quantification)
- Long-term outcomes (20-year horizon) inherently uncertain
- Attribution assumptions could be challenged

**Evaluator**: This analysis completed by Impact Evaluator agent using SROI, CEA, trajectory uplift, and systemic impact frameworks. All assumptions documented transparently. Confidence levels reflect evaluation uncertainty honestly.

**Date**: 2024-12-24

## Critical Review Section

### Critical Review Conducted By: Devil's Advocate Agent
**Date**: 2024-12-24  
**Purpose**: Challenge assumptions, surface blind spots, document disagreements, ensure all perspectives captured before funding decision

---

## Overall Assessment

The Impact Evaluator has completed a thorough quantitative analysis of both programs. However, several critical assumptions, methodological concerns, and strategic blind spots need to be surfaced before proceeding with funding decisions. This review identifies areas where the analysis may be overly optimistic, where key risks are understated, and where alternative interpretations merit serious consideration.

**Approval Status: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR PROGRAM 1, REJECT PROGRAM 2 AS PROPOSED**

---

## Program 1: PSLE Math Intensive Care - Critical Analysis

### Challenge 1: SROI Assumptions Are Optimistic

**Impact Evaluator's Claim**: 3.2:1 to 4.1:1 SROI ratio

**Critical Concerns:**

1. **Attribution Rate (70%) Is High**
   - Evaluator assumes 70% attribution, meaning 70% of outcomes caused by program
   - But: Students receive school instruction, may have family support changes, natural maturation effects
   - More conservative estimate: 50-60% attribution
   - Impact: Would reduce SROI to 2.3:1 to 3.5:1

2. **Drop-off Rate (20%) May Be Low**
   - Evaluator assumes only 20% fade-out of effects over 20 years
   - Research on educational interventions shows 30-50% fade-out in long-term follow-ups
   - If drop-off is 40%: SROI drops to 2.5:1 to 3.2:1

3. **Lifetime Earnings Assumptions**
   - Projecting 20-year earnings impacts from 18-month intervention is highly speculative
   - Labor market changes, technology disruption, credential inflation all uncertain
   - Singapore economy may shift dramatically (already seeing wage compression, AI impacts)

4. **Monetization of Social-Emotional Benefits ($3,000-$5,000) Is Soft**
   - How was this value calculated? What methodology?
   - Literature-based estimates often inflated
   - These values should be treated as highly uncertain

**Alternative Interpretation:**
- Conservative SROI: 2.0:1 to 3.0:1 (still positive, but less compelling)
- This is still justifiable for funding, but stakeholders should know the optimistic assumptions

**DECISION POINT**: Are we comfortable funding at 2.0:1 SROI if assumptions prove conservative?

---

### Challenge 2: Comparison Group Strategy Is Weak

**Impact Evaluator's Claim**: "Historical data from similar demographic students" is adequate comparison

**Critical Concern:**
- Historical controls are WEAK evidence
- Selection bias: Who enrolls in this program vs who doesn't?
- Families that enroll may differ systematically: more motivated parents, more stable home environments, already improving trajectories
- This is a MAJOR threat to causal validity

**Evaluator's Mitigation**: Suggests "randomized waitlist control if ethical and feasible"

**Devil's Advocate Challenge**:
- Is waitlist randomization actually feasible?
- If program oversubscribed: ethical (random allocation is fair)
- If program undersubscribed: not possible (everyone who wants it gets it)
- What if demand is exactly at capacity? Then no control group

**Better Approach**:
- Matched comparison from non-participating students at TTKC and similar community centers
- Pre-program equivalence testing on demographics, baseline math scores, family characteristics
- Conduct propensity score matching to adjust for selection bias
- Acknowledge remaining limitations honestly

**CONDITION FOR FUNDING**: Require matched comparison group with statistical equivalence testing, not just "historical data"

---

### Challenge 3: Cost Per Outcome ($23,400) Is High - Justification Unclear

**Impact Evaluator's Claim**: "Higher cost per outcome than early intervention, but addresses critical gap population"

**Devil's Advocate Challenge**:
- Yes, it's more expensive than early intervention ($15-20k government LSM program)
- But: Why not invest in EXPANDING government LSM to P5-P6 instead of creating parallel program?
- Policy advocacy for government program expansion could reach 100x more students for same cost
- Is creating a new nonprofit program the most STRATEGIC use of philanthropic capital?

**Alternative Strategic Options**:
1. **Fund expansion of government LSM program** - partner with MOE to pilot P5-P6 extension
2. **Fund research documenting P5-P6 gap** - create evidence base for policy change
3. **Fund capacity building at existing centers** - help existing programs improve rather than create new one

**Question for Decision-Maker**: Is $23,400 per outcome acceptable when alternative strategies might achieve greater systemic change?

**Counter-Argument** (acknowledging other perspective):
- Government programs move slowly; nonprofit pilot can demonstrate feasibility faster
- Parallel program creates competitive pressure on government to improve
- Replication model could influence MOE even without direct partnership

**This is a strategic disagreement that HUMAN must decide**: Direct service vs policy advocacy approach?

---

### Challenge 4: Instructor Quality Is CRITICAL and Understated

**Impact Evaluator's Risk Assessment**: "HIGH RISK if instructional quality not achieved"

**Devil's Advocate**: This risk is CRITICAL and may be SHOW-STOPPER

**Why This Matters More Than Evaluator Suggests:**
- Specialized remedial math teachers are SCARCE in Singapore market
- Teachers who can work with severely behind students require different skills than typical teachers
- Burnout risk is high (intensive work with struggling students)
- Budget allocates $150k for instructors (realistic for 2-3 specialized teachers)
- If can't recruit/retain right teachers, program FAILS

**Mitigations Proposed by Evaluator**: "Partner with NIE for training pipeline"

**Devil's Advocate Reality Check**:
- NIE partnership is aspirational, not confirmed
- Training pipeline takes years to build, pilot needs teachers NOW
- What is TTKC's current capacity to recruit specialized educators?
- Have they done market research on availability?

**Missing Information**:
- Does TTKC have relationships with qualified math educators?
- What is the actual labor market for specialized remedial math teachers in Singapore?
- Is $150k sufficient to attract and retain the right people?

**CONDITION FOR FUNDING**: Require TTKC to demonstrate instructor recruitment strategy and realistic assessment of labor market before funds released

---

### Challenge 5: Replication Framework May Be Premature

**Impact Evaluator's Enthusiasm**: "Designed for scalability from inception," "Target: 5-10 centers within 3 years"

**Devil's Advocate Concern**: Replication is getting ahead of ourselves

**Why This Is Problematic:**
- Pilot hasn't been tested yet, but already planning for 5-10x scale in 3 years
- What if pilot reveals design flaws? Curriculum doesn't work? Instructor model unsustainable?
- What if pilot works at TTKC but doesn't transfer to other contexts?
- Replication mindset may lock in design before learning from pilot

**Risk**: 
- Pressure to declare "success" prematurely to justify replication timeline
- Rush to scale before model proven
- Documentation focus may distract from program quality in pilot

**Alternative Approach**:
- Focus first 18 months purely on pilot learning and iteration
- Document what works and what doesn't (including failures)
- Make replication decision AFTER pilot completes, based on evidence
- If successful: Year 2-3 focus on replication

**Question for Decision-Maker**: Is replication timeline appropriate or premature?

---

### Challenge 6: Systemic Impact Score (7/10) May Be Inflated

**Impact Evaluator's Claim**: "Primarily UPSTREAM (Moderate-High Systemic Potential)" - Score 7/10

**Devil's Advocate Challenge**: This intervention is actually MIXED upstream/downstream, score should be 5-6/10

**Why Systemic Impact Is Overstated:**
1. **Not Addressing Root Causes**: Students are already 2+ years behind by P5. Why?
   - Early childhood educational gaps (upstream of this program)
   - Family poverty and stress (upstream)
   - Parent education levels (upstream)
   - Language barriers (upstream)
   - Ineffective P1-P4 instruction (upstream)
   - **This program treats symptom (learning gaps) not causes (why gaps developed)**

2. **Leverage Point Is Later Than Ideal**: Yes, PSLE is critical, but by P5-P6 much damage already done
   - More cost-effective to intervene in P1-P3 or preschool
   - Evaluator acknowledges this but doesn't adjust systemic impact score accordingly

3. **Systems Change Potential Is Uncertain**: Evaluator claims "potential to influence education policy"
   - But: No MOE engagement strategy outlined
   - Unclear how nonprofit pilot would influence government policy
   - Government may view as threat (implicit criticism of LSM program ending at P4)

4. **Prevention vs Treatment**: Evaluator calls this "HIGH" on prevention
   - **It's actually TREATMENT** - students already failed, program remediates
   - True prevention would intervene before students fall behind

**More Accurate Systemic Impact Score: 5/10 (Moderate)**
- Still valuable, addresses real gap, improves trajectories
- But: Primarily treating downstream consequences of upstream failures
- Limited systemic change potential without policy advocacy component

**Question for Decision-Maker**: Should we fund remediation programs (treat symptoms) or invest in preventing students from falling behind in first place?

**Counter-Argument** (acknowledging other perspective):
- Can't let students currently behind suffer while we fix upstream problems (both/and, not either/or)
- Remediation programs reveal systemic gaps that can inform policy
- Immediate relief (remediation) + long-term change (prevention) both needed

---

### Challenge 7: Singapore Context Fit (9/10) Is Accurate BUT...

**Impact Evaluator's Score**: 9/10 (Excellent)

**Devil's Advocate Agreement**: Yes, this program fits Singapore context well

**BUT: Critical Context Not Addressed**:

1. **Tuition Culture Stigma**
   - Singapore has intense tuition culture
   - Remedial education carries stigma (students/families may resist)
   - How will TTKC frame this to avoid stigma?
   - Will target families actually enroll?

2. **PSLE Stress Context**
   - PSLE already high-stress for students
   - Adding 6 hours/week more instruction increases stress load
   - Is intensive instruction approach right for students who may already have math anxiety?
   - Alternative: Lower-intensity, longer-duration, more holistic approach?

3. **Government Relations**
   - MOE may view parallel program as implicit criticism
   - Schools may not cooperate with student identification or progress sharing
   - Need MOE buy-in for success, but no engagement strategy outlined

4. **Language and Ethnicity**
   - Evaluator mentions curriculum must work across Tamil/Malay/Chinese-medium students
   - But: No detail on how curriculum addresses this
   - Language barriers in math instruction are real challenge

**These Are Implementation Risks That Could Derail Program Despite "Excellent" Context Fit**

---

### Challenge 8: Confidence Level (65% - Medium) Should Be LOWER

**Impact Evaluator's Confidence**: 65% (Medium)

**Devil's Advocate Assessment**: Should be 50-55% (Low-Medium)

**Why Lower Confidence:**
- Instructor recruitment risk understated (should reduce confidence more)
- Comparison group strategy weak (historical controls insufficient)
- SROI assumptions optimistic (if conservative, may not be compelling investment)
- Replication assumptions premature
- No pilot data whatsoever

**Factors That DON'T Increase Confidence As Much As Evaluator Suggests:**
- "Strong theoretical foundation" - Yes, but theory ≠ implementation
- "Proven pedagogy" - In controlled research settings, not community centers
- "Clear intervention logic" - Logic is clear, but execution is hard

**Reality Check**: This is a brand-new program, never tested, with unproven organizational capacity, trying to recruit scarce specialized staff, serving a challenging population, with weak evaluation design.

**More Honest Confidence Level: 50-55%**

---

## Program 1: Devil's Advocate Recommendation

**CONDITIONAL APPROVAL - Fund with Stricter Conditions**

**I AGREE with Impact Evaluator's FUND recommendation BUT with MORE CONDITIONS and MORE CONSERVATIVE FRAMING**

**Funding Amount**: $375,000 for 18-month pilot (same as Impact Evaluator)

**But ADD These Conditions Beyond What Impact Evaluator Specified:**

1. **Instructor Recruitment Demonstration** (BEFORE funds released)
   - TTKC must demonstrate viable recruitment strategy
   - Show evidence of qualified candidates or partnership commitments
   - Prove $150k budget is sufficient for market rate

2. **Matched Comparison Group** (not just historical data)
   - Partner with evaluation specialist (NIE/SMU)
   - Identify matched comparison students at enrollment
   - Pre-program equivalence testing required

3. **De-risk Replication Timeline**
   - Remove 3-year replication target from pilot phase
   - Focus pilot on learning and iteration, not scale
   - Make replication decision AFTER pilot evidence available

4. **MOE Engagement Strategy**
   - Develop plan for engaging MOE (awareness, not partnership)
   - Ensure schools will cooperate with student identification
   - Address potential concerns about parallel program

5. **Conservative SROI Framing**
   - Present 2.0-3.0:1 SROI range (conservative assumptions)
   - Don't oversell with optimistic 3.2-4.1:1 projections
   - Set expectations appropriately

6. **Stress and Wellbeing Monitoring**
   - Track student stress and math anxiety (not just academic outcomes)
   - Be prepared to adjust intensity if harmful effects observed
   - Remember: Wellbeing matters, not just test scores

**Go/No-Go Decision Points** (same as Impact Evaluator, but ENFORCE STRICTLY):
- 6-month: If <75% retention or <70% attendance → PAUSE and assess
- 12-month: If <60% showing measurable gains → Consider termination
- 18-month: If <45% passing PSLE → Do NOT proceed to scale

**Honest Framing for Decision-Maker**:
- This is a MODERATE-risk investment, not low-risk
- Outcomes are UNCERTAIN despite clear theory of change
- Strategic question remains: Direct service vs policy advocacy?
- Worth trying BUT keep expectations realistic and monitoring strict

---

## Program 2: 13+ CampusImpact Engagement - Critical Analysis

### Challenge 1: Impact Evaluator Is TOO POLITE - This Program Should NOT Be Funded As Proposed

**Impact Evaluator's Recommendation**: "DEFER funding until program model is better defined; fund pilot design phase instead"

**Devil's Advocate Stronger Position**: "REJECT as currently proposed, even design phase funding is questionable"

**Why Stronger Rejection:**
1. **No Program Model After How Many Months/Years of Thinking?**
   - If CampusImpact has been working in this space, why is program model still undefined?
   - Suggests either: (a) Haven't done homework, or (b) Problem is actually intractable
   - Why would 6-month design phase solve what hasn't been solved already?

2. **"Seeking Input" Is Not a Plan**
   - Program description literally says "Seeking Input" and "Input Needed"
   - This is not ready for philanthropic proposal stage
   - Should have done this work BEFORE approaching funders

3. **$30,000 for Design Phase May Be Waste**
   - What if design phase reveals problem not solvable or not differentiated?
   - Then $30k spent with no program to show for it
   - Alternative: Do this work internally before requesting philanthropic capital

---

### Challenge 2: SROI (2.5-3.8:1) Is MEANINGLESS Given Uncertainty

**Impact Evaluator's SROI**: 2.5:1 to 3.8:1 (with extensive caveats)

**Devil's Advocate**: These numbers are PURE SPECULATION and should be IGNORED

**Why SROI Is Meaningless Here:**
- No program model defined → Can't estimate costs accurately
- No activities specified → Can't estimate outcomes
- Attribution assumptions (60%) are WILD GUESS with no basis
- Evaluator himself rates confidence at 35% (LOW)

**The Range Is So Wide It's Useless:**
- 2.5:1 to 3.8:1 is a 52% spread
- With 35% confidence, real range could be 1.0:1 to 5.0:1
- Could break even or could be great investment - we have NO IDEA

**Impact Evaluator Acknowledges This**: "SROI highly uncertain," "CRITICAL CAUTION," "highly speculative"

**Then Why Report These Numbers At All?**
- Including numbers gives false precision
- Decision-makers may anchor on midpoint (3.1:1) and ignore uncertainty
- More honest approach: "SROI cannot be estimated without defined program model"

---

### Challenge 3: CEA ($36,000 per Secondary Completer) Comparison Is Misleading

**Impact Evaluator's Cost Per Outcome**: $36,000 per additional secondary school completer

**Benchmarks Provided**: "Comprehensive youth development programs: $25,000-$40,000 per significant outcome"

**Devil's Advocate Challenge**: This comparison is MISLEADING

**Why:**
1. **Assumed 2-Year Engagement** - But program says "ongoing relationship model (minimum 2-year)"
   - What if actual engagement needs to be 3-4 years to achieve outcome?
   - Then cost per outcome jumps to $54,000-$72,000 (no longer competitive)

2. **Attribution Assumption (60%) May Be Way Too High**
   - With schools, families, peers, government programs all influencing outcomes
   - Attribution could be 30-40% realistically
   - If 40%: cost per outcome becomes $60,000 (2× the benchmark)

3. **Comparison Programs May Actually Be Different**
   - "Comprehensive youth development programs" - which ones? What evidence?
   - Are they serving same risk level population?
   - Are they using same outcome metrics?
   - Benchmarking is sloppy without specifics

---

### Challenge 4: Confidence Level (35%) Is DISQUALIFYING

**Impact Evaluator's Confidence**: 35% (LOW)

**Impact Evaluator's Own Words**: "This is among the lowest confidence ratings for a philanthropic program evaluation"

**Devil's Advocate**: If confidence is 35%, why are we even discussing funding?

**What 35% Confidence Means:**
- 65% chance the program does NOT achieve projected outcomes
- 2/3 probability of failure or significant underperformance
- Would you invest in a business with 35% success probability?

**This Is Not "Venture Philanthropy" Risk - It's UNCLEAR PROGRAM DESIGN**
- Venture philanthropy accepts risk on DEFINED models with uncertain outcomes
- This is accepting risk on UNDEFINED model with uncertain outcomes
- That's not risk-taking, that's recklessness

**Comparison:**
- Program 1: 65% confidence → Justifiable risk for pilot
- Program 2: 35% confidence → Not ready for investment at any scale

---

### Challenge 5: "Crowded Space" Problem Is UNDERSTATED

**Impact Evaluator's Concern**: "Crowded programmatic space with unclear differentiation"

**Devil's Advocate Stronger Statement**: "No evidence this program adds value beyond what already exists"

**Existing Programs Listed by Evaluator:**
- MOE: After-school care, student support, school counseling
- MSF: Youth intervention programs, family services
- CDC: Youth programs and community engagement
- NCSS: 500+ social service agencies serving youth
- SHINE, Boys' Brigade, Girls' Brigade, Youth Corps, etc.

**Critical Question NOT Answered**: What will THIS program do that NONE of these existing programs do?

**Evaluator's Weak Differentiators:**
- "CampusImpact platform integration (technology + in-person)" - So what? Others have platforms too.
- "Focus on post-primary transition specifically" - Others already serve this age group.
- "Potential for data-driven approach" - Others collect data too.

**This Is Not Differentiation - This Is Buzzwords**

**Honest Assessment**: No clear value proposition beyond existing services.

---

### Challenge 6: Systemic Impact Score (5/10) Is GENEROUS

**Impact Evaluator's Score**: 5/10 (Moderate)

**Devil's Advocate**: Should be 3-4/10 (Low-Moderate)

**Why Even Lower:**
1. **Purely Downstream** - Not even mixed upstream/downstream
   - Youth are 13-16, already at-risk, family instability already present
   - Program treats symptoms with NO upstream component
   
2. **No Systems Change Potential** - Evaluator says "Limited systems change potential (similar programs already exist)"
   - If many similar programs exist, one more doesn't change system
   - CampusImpact isn't proposing policy advocacy or systemic intervention
   
3. **Relationship-Intensive = Hard to Scale** - Evaluator acknowledges "hard to scale without quality dilution"
   - If can't scale, systemic impact is inherently limited
   - Realistic reach: 200-400 youth annually (evaluator's estimate)
   - Singapore has tens of thousands of at-risk youth (marginal impact)

4. **Late-Stage Intervention** - Evaluator notes "less cost-effective than early childhood or primary school"
   - Systemic impact should account for cost-effectiveness
   - Late intervention means higher cost for lower impact

**More Accurate Score: 3-4/10 (Low-Moderate)**

---

### Challenge 7: Singapore Context Fit (6/10) Is ACCURATE and THAT'S THE PROBLEM

**Impact Evaluator's Score**: 6/10 (Moderate)

**Devil's Advocate**: Yes, 6/10 fit is accurate, and that's NOT GOOD ENOUGH

**Why "Moderate" Fit Is Insufficient:**
- Singapore already has extensive youth services
- Government programs well-funded and comprehensive
- Nonprofit sector already crowded
- **A new program needs EXCELLENT context fit (8-9/10) to justify investment**
- 6/10 fit means "marginally useful at best"

**Concerns Identified by Evaluator:**
1. "Crowded space: Many youth programs already exist"
2. "Unclear differentiation: What does this program offer that others don't?"
3. "Government coordination: Requires strong partnerships - not addressed"
4. "Sustainability: How does this differ from existing government-funded youth services?"

**These Are Not Minor Concerns - These Are FATAL FLAWS**

---

### Challenge 8: Evaluator's "Defer to Design Phase" Is Too GENEROUS

**Impact Evaluator's Alternative**: Fund $30,000 for 6-month design phase

**Devil's Advocate Concern**: This is throwing good money after bad

**Why Design Phase Is Questionable:**

1. **Why Hasn't This Work Been Done Already?**
   - If CampusImpact is established organization with "track record," why no program model?
   - Design phase work should be done before approaching funders
   - Asking philanthropist to fund "figuring it out" is not appropriate use of charitable capital

2. **What If Design Phase Concludes Program Not Viable?**
   - Then $30,000 spent with nothing to show
   - This is operational capacity building, not programmatic philanthropy
   - Should be funded by organizational reserves or capacity-building grants, not program funding

3. **Design Phase May Paper Over Fundamental Problem**
   - Problem may not be "we need better design"
   - Problem may be "this intervention doesn't work" or "we're not the right org to do it"
   - 6-month design phase won't solve these deeper issues

**Alternative Recommendation**: 
- CampusImpact should do this work with own resources or seek capacity-building grant elsewhere
- Return to philanthropist when program model is defined and piloted (even if small pilot)
- Come back with preliminary evidence, not preliminary plans

---

## Program 2: Devil's Advocate Recommendation

**REJECT FUNDING - Do Not Fund Design Phase**

**Recommendation**: CampusImpact should:
1. Define program model internally (not with philanthropic funding)
2. Run small pilot with own resources or other funding
3. Collect preliminary evidence
4. Return with defined model and initial outcomes if seeking funding

**If Philanthropist Wants to Support Youth Programming:**
- **Better Options**:
  1. Fund expansion of EXISTING proven programs (Boys' Brigade, SHINE, etc.)
  2. Fund evaluation of existing youth programs to identify what works
  3. Fund policy research on secondary dropout and what interventions needed
  4. Fund capacity building across youth sector (not one organization)

**Why This Is Better Use of Capital:**
- Builds on proven programs rather than creating new undefined one
- Addresses knowledge gaps in sector (what works for at-risk youth?)
- Strengthens existing infrastructure rather than fragmenting further

## Disagreements Between Impact Evaluator and Devil's Advocate

### Program 1 Disagreements:

1. **SROI Range**
   - Impact Evaluator: 3.2-4.1:1 (moderate to optimistic)
   - Devil's Advocate: 2.0-3.0:1 (conservative assumptions)
   - **Implication**: Still positive, but less compelling case

2. **Systemic Impact**
   - Impact Evaluator: 7/10 (high)
   - Devil's Advocate: 5-6/10 (moderate)
   - **Implication**: More downstream/remediation than upstream/prevention

3. **Confidence Level**
   - Impact Evaluator: 65% (medium)
   - Devil's Advocate: 50-55% (low-medium)
   - **Implication**: Higher risk than Impact Evaluator suggests

4. **Strategic Approach**
   - Impact Evaluator: Direct service fills gap
   - Devil's Advocate: Consider policy advocacy for LSM expansion instead
   - **Implication**: Different theories of change for systemic impact

**BOTH AGREE**: Program 1 should be funded, but with different risk framings and conditions

**DECISION FOR HUMAN**: Which framing resonates? Moderate-risk direct service or explore policy advocacy alternative?

---

### Program 2 Disagreements:

1. **Design Phase Value**
   - Impact Evaluator: Fund $30k design phase
   - Devil's Advocate: Reject design phase funding
   - **Implication**: Is design phase appropriate use of philanthropic capital?

2. **SROI Reporting**
   - Impact Evaluator: Report 2.5-3.8:1 with caveats
   - Devil's Advocate: Don't report SROI at all (meaningless)
   - **Implication**: How much uncertainty is too much?

3. **Confidence Level Threshold**
   - Impact Evaluator: 35% confidence → defer to design phase
   - Devil's Advocate: 35% confidence → reject outright
   - **Implication**: What confidence level justifies any investment?

4. **Strategic Alternative**
   - Impact Evaluator: Design new program model
   - Devil's Advocate: Fund existing proven programs instead
   - **Implication**: Create new vs strengthen existing?

**BOTH AGREE**: Program 2 should NOT be funded as currently proposed

**DISAGREEMENT**: Whether to support CampusImpact's design process or redirect funding elsewhere

**DECISION FOR HUMAN**: Invest in CampusImpact's potential or redirect to proven alternatives?

## Critical Questions for Decision-Maker

### Program 1: PSLE Math Intensive Care

1. **Strategic Philosophy**: Direct service (remediation) vs policy advocacy (systemic change)?
   - Fund TTKC program to serve 30-50 students?
   - Or fund MOE advocacy to extend LSM to P5-P6 (potentially 1000s of students)?

2. **Risk Tolerance**: Comfortable with 50-55% confidence (Devil's Advocate) or need higher certainty?

3. **SROI Expectations**: Is 2.0-3.0:1 SROI (conservative) sufficient, or need 3.2-4.1:1 (optimistic)?

4. **Replication Timeline**: Comfortable with 3-year replication target, or want pilot-focused approach?

5. **Conditions Acceptance**: Will TTKC accept stricter conditions (instructor demonstration, matched comparison, MOE engagement)?

### Program 2: 13+ CampusImpact Engagement

1. **Design Phase Value**: Is $30,000 design phase appropriate use of philanthropic capital?
   - Or should CampusImpact develop model with own resources?

2. **Risk Tolerance**: Is 35% confidence ever acceptable for any funding level?

3. **Strategic Alternative**: Better to strengthen existing youth programs than create new undefined one?

4. **Confidence in Organization**: Does CampusImpact's lack of defined model signal organizational capacity concerns?

5. **Youth Focus Priority**: If passionate about youth programming, fund proven programs or potential ones?

## Blind Spots and Considerations Not Addressed by Impact Evaluator

### Program 1 Blind Spots:

1. **Student Voice Missing**
   - What do students themselves want?
   - Have at-risk P5-P6 students been consulted on program design?
   - Is intensive math instruction what they need, or is holistic support more important?

2. **Parent Capacity Assumptions**
   - Program assumes parents can engage bi-weekly
   - But target population: lower-income families, parents likely working multiple jobs
   - Language barriers for non-English speaking parents
   - Is parent engagement model realistic?

3. **School Coordination Reality Check**
   - Program needs school cooperation for student identification, progress sharing
   - Schools already overwhelmed with responsibilities
   - Will principals actually cooperate or see this as extra burden?
   - No MOE endorsement = schools may not engage

4. **Opportunity Cost for Students**
   - 6 hours/week additional instruction
   - Students already spending 30-35 hours in school
   - Plus homework time
   - Total: 40-45 hours/week on academics
   - What are they giving up? (Play, family time, rest, exploration)
   - Is intensive instruction appropriate or is it additional stress?

5. **Alternative Pedagogy Not Considered**
   - Program assumes traditional instruction (small group, but still teacher-led)
   - What about game-based learning, peer tutoring, math anxiety reduction approaches?
   - Singapore pushing "Learn for Life" initiative - is intensive instruction aligned?

### Program 2 Blind Spots:

1. **Youth Voice Completely Missing**
   - "Seeking input" but no evidence youth have been asked what they want
   - Adults designing programs for youth often miss mark
   - 13-16 year olds have strong opinions - have they been consulted?

2. **Why Are Youth At-Risk?**
   - Program treats "at-risk" as given
   - But WHY are they at-risk?
   - Family poverty? Learning difficulties? Mental health? Peer influence? Trauma?
   - Different causes require different interventions
   - One-size-fits-all approach likely ineffective

3. **Technology Assumption**
   - CampusImpact platform as solution
   - But: At-risk youth may lack devices, internet access, digital literacy
   - Technology can be barrier, not enabler
   - Need to validate technology access before assuming platform viability

4. **Mentor Quality and Sustainability**
   - Program relies heavily on volunteer mentors
   - Volunteer attrition is typically high
   - Youth need consistent relationships, not rotating volunteers
   - Is volunteer model sustainable for 2+ year engagements?

5. **Outcome Metrics Don't Capture What Matters**
   - Program measures secondary completion, employment rates
   - But: Youth development is about identity, purpose, belonging, resilience
   - Narrow metrics miss holistic wellbeing
   - May optimize for wrong outcomes

## Final Assessment and Approval Status

### Program 1: PSLE Math Intensive Care - CONDITIONAL APPROVAL

**Approval Status**: ✅ **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS**

**Conditions**:
1. Demonstrate instructor recruitment viability before funds released
2. Matched comparison group (not historical data)
3. Remove 3-year replication target from pilot phase
4. Develop MOE engagement strategy
5. Present conservative SROI framing (2.0-3.0:1)
6. Monitor student stress and wellbeing (not just academics)
7. Strict enforcement of 6-month and 12-month go/no-go milestones

**Risk Level**: MODERATE (not low as Impact Evaluator suggests)

**Expected Outcome**: 50-55% confidence (Devil's Advocate) vs 65% (Impact Evaluator)

**Strategic Consideration**: Decision-maker should evaluate direct service vs policy advocacy alternative

---

### Program 2: 13+ CampusImpact Engagement - REJECTED

**Approval Status**: ❌ **REJECTED AS PROPOSED**

**Rationale**:
- No defined program model
- 35% confidence is disqualifying
- Crowded programmatic space with unclear differentiation
- Design phase ($30k) is questionable use of philanthropic capital
- CampusImpact should develop model internally before seeking program funding

**Alternative Recommendations**:
1. CampusImpact: Define model with own resources, pilot, return with evidence
2. Philanthropist: Fund existing proven youth programs instead
3. Philanthropist: Fund sector-wide evaluation of what works for at-risk youth

**Strategic Consideration**: Create new undefined program vs strengthen existing proven programs?

---
