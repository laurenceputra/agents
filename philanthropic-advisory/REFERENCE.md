## SROI (Social Return on Investment) Methodology

### Formula
```
SROI = (Net Present Value of Social Benefits) / Investment
```

### Calculation Steps

1. **Identify outcomes** (e.g., youth retained in school, families stabilized)
2. **Value outcomes** (e.g., lifetime earnings uplift = $120,000)
3. **Apply adjustments**:
   - **Deadweight**: Outcomes that would have occurred anyway (subtract)
   - **Attribution**: Proportion directly caused by program (multiply)
   - **Drop-off**: Benefits that fade over time (apply decay factor)
4. **Calculate NPV**: Discount future benefits to present value
5. **Divide by investment**: NPV / total program cost

### Interpretation Benchmarks
- **3:1 to 5:1**: Typical range for social programs
- **5:1 to 10:1**: Strong return
- **>10:1**: Exceptional (scrutinize assumptions carefully)

### Common Assumptions to Document
- Deadweight percentage (typical: 10-25%)
- Attribution percentage (typical: 50-80%)
- Drop-off rate (typical: 20-50% over 5 years)
- Discount rate (typical: 3-5% for social programs)
- Time horizon (typical: 5-20 years depending on intervention)

## CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis) Methodology

### Formula
```
CEA = Total Cost / Number of Outcome Units Achieved
```

### Calculation Steps

1. **Define standardized outcome unit** (e.g., "youth retained in school", "family stabilized")
2. **Calculate cost per beneficiary** (total program cost / number of participants)
3. **Calculate success rate** (% of participants achieving outcome)
4. **Divide cost by success rate** to get cost per outcome

### Example
- Program serves 100 youth at $3,000 each = $300,000 total
- Success rate: 70% complete program
- Cost per outcome: $3,000 / 0.70 = **$4,286 per youth retained**

### Use Cases
- Compare programs achieving similar outcomes
- Identify most cost-effective interventions
- Benchmark against existing programs

## Trajectory Uplift Analysis

### Definition
Change in beneficiary life trajectory attributable to intervention, comparing baseline (without program) to intervention (with program) outcomes.

### Methodology

1. **Establish baseline trajectory**: Projected outcomes without intervention
   - Use comparison group data, historical data, or research literature
   - Example: 50% of at-risk youth graduate high school without intervention

2. **Establish intervention trajectory**: Projected outcomes with intervention
   - Use program data, evaluation results, or pilot studies
   - Example: 85% of program participants graduate high school

3. **Calculate uplift**: Difference between intervention and baseline
   - Example: 85% - 50% = **35% uplift** in graduation rate

### Time Horizons
- **Short-term** (1-2 years): Immediate outcomes (crisis stabilization, skill acquisition)
- **Medium-term** (5-10 years): Life transitions (employment, education completion)
- **Long-term** (10-20 years): Life trajectory (earnings, health, family stability)

## Systemic Impact Assessment

### Framework: Upstream, Midstream, Downstream

**Upstream (Prevention - Root Causes)**
- Addresses fundamental systems creating problems
- Examples: Affordable housing policy, living wage campaigns, early childhood development
- Impact: Long-term, prevents problems from occurring

**Midstream (Early Intervention)**
- Catches issues early before they become crises
- Examples: School-based mental health, parenting support, job training
- Impact: Medium-term, reduces severity and duration

**Downstream (Symptom Relief)**
- Treats acute problems after they occur
- Examples: Crisis intervention, emergency assistance, shelter services
- Impact: Short-term, alleviates immediate suffering

### Scoring Systemic Impact
- **Low**: Purely downstream, treats symptoms without addressing causes
- **Medium**: Mix of midstream/downstream, some early intervention
- **High**: Primarily upstream/midstream, prevents problems or catches them early

## Singapore-Specific Context

### Demographics (2024 Estimates)
- **Population**: 5.7 million total
- **At-Risk Youth**: ~50,000 (ages 13-18)
- **Lower-Income Families**: ~120,000 families (<$3,000/month household income)
- **Children from Lower-Income Households**: 20% of all children
- **Families Receiving MSF Crisis Support**: 10,000+ annually
- **Aging Population**: Increasing caregiving strain on working families

### Key Government Programs

**Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)**
- **ComCare**: Financial assistance for low-income families
- **KidSTART**: Early childhood development for vulnerable families
- **Family Service Centers (FSCs)**: 46 centers providing case management

**Ministry of Education (MOE)**
- **Financial Assistance Scheme**: School fees, meals, transport for lower-income students
- **School-based support**: Counseling, remedial programs, learning support

**Ministry of Manpower (MOM)**
- **Progressive Wage Model**: Wage increases for low-wage workers
- **SkillsFuture**: Workforce development and upskilling

### Nonprofit Landscape
- **National Council of Social Service (NCSS)**: Coordinates 500+ social service agencies
- **Community Development Councils (CDCs)**: Provide localized support and programs
- **Philanthropy Trends**: Growing focus on impact measurement, evidence-based giving, systemic change

### Measurement Standards
- **Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise (raiSE)**: Promotes impact measurement frameworks
- **Charity Council**: Requires financial transparency and governance standards
- **Code of Governance**: Best practices for nonprofit boards and management

## Portfolio Strategy Frameworks

### Concentration Risk Guidelines

**By Cause Area**:
- No single cause area >40% of total giving (maintain diversification)
- Balance prevention (upstream) with treatment (downstream)

**By Stage**:
- Target mix: 60% upstream/midstream, 40% downstream
- Prevent "all crisis response" or "all prevention" portfolios

**By Geography**:
- If focused on Singapore, consider regional/international balance (10-20%)
- Geographic concentration acceptable if deeply informed

### Portfolio Balance Principles

1. **Theory of Change Diversity**
   - Include programs addressing problem from multiple angles
   - Example: Education portfolio includes tutoring (midstream), scholarships (downstream), curriculum reform advocacy (upstream)

2. **Risk Profile Mix**
   - Balance proven programs (lower risk) with innovative approaches (higher risk)
   - Typical mix: 70% proven, 30% experimental

3. **Time Horizon Balance**
   - Include short-term wins (visible impact) and long-term investments (systemic change)
   - Avoid all "quick wins" or all "10-year bets"

4. **Beneficiary Breadth**
   - Serve multiple at-risk populations (youth, families, elderly, refugees, etc.)
   - Avoid over-concentration on single demographic

### Strategic Gaps to Fill

Common gaps in Singapore philanthropic landscape:
- **Secondary school support** (most programs focus on primary or post-secondary)
- **Crisis prevention** (heavy emphasis on crisis response, less on prevention)
- **Family systems approaches** (many programs target individuals, not family units)
- **Mental health** (growing need, limited capacity)
- **Employment pathways** (training exists, but job placement and retention support lacking)

## Data Quality Assessment Framework

### Evaluation Rigor Levels

**Level 1: Weak Evidence**
- Self-reported outcomes, no comparison group
- Small sample size (N<50)
- Short follow-up (<6 months)
- High attrition (>40% lost to follow-up)

**Level 2: Moderate Evidence**
- Operational outcome definitions
- Historical or matched comparison group
- Reasonable sample size (N=50-200)
- Medium-term follow-up (6-12 months)
- Moderate attrition (20-40%)

**Level 3: Strong Evidence**
- Randomized control trial or quasi-experimental design
- Large sample size (N>200)
- Long-term follow-up (12+ months)
- Low attrition (<20%)
- Independent evaluation

### Common Data Quality Issues

**Selection Bias**
- Program serves most motivated beneficiaries (success inflated)
- **Mitigation**: Comparison group, random selection, document selection criteria

**Attrition Bias**
- Beneficiaries lost to follow-up may have worse outcomes
- **Mitigation**: Track attrition rates, sensitivity analysis, intention-to-treat analysis

**Reporting Bias**
- Self-reported outcomes may be overstated
- **Mitigation**: Third-party verification, administrative data, objective measures

**Small Sample Bias**
- Small pilot results may not replicate at scale
- **Mitigation**: Larger validation study, external replication, conservative estimates
