## SROI (Social Return on Investment) Methodology

### Formula
```
SROI = (Net Present Value of Social Benefits) / Investment
```

### Calculation Steps

1. **Identify outcomes** (e.g., youth retained in school, families stabilized)
2. **Value outcomes** (e.g., lifetime earnings uplift = $120,000)
3. **Apply adjustments**:
   - **Deadweight**: Outcomes that would have occurred anyway (subtract)
   - **Attribution**: Proportion directly caused by program (multiply)
   - **Drop-off**: Benefits that fade over time (apply decay factor)
4. **Calculate NPV**: Discount future benefits to present value
5. **Divide by investment**: NPV / total program cost

### Interpretation Benchmarks
- **3:1 to 5:1**: Typical range for social programs
- **5:1 to 10:1**: Strong return
- **>10:1**: Exceptional (scrutinize assumptions carefully)

### Common Assumptions to Document
- Deadweight percentage (typical: 10-25%)
- Attribution percentage (typical: 50-80%)
- Drop-off rate (typical: 20-50% over 5 years)
- Discount rate (typical: 3-5% for social programs)
- Time horizon (typical: 5-20 years depending on intervention)

## CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis) Methodology

### Formula
```
CEA = Total Cost / Number of Outcome Units Achieved
```

### Calculation Steps

1. **Define standardized outcome unit** (e.g., "youth retained in school", "family stabilized")
2. **Calculate cost per beneficiary** (total program cost / number of participants)
3. **Calculate success rate** (% of participants achieving outcome)
4. **Divide cost by success rate** to get cost per outcome

### Example
- Program serves 100 youth at $3,000 each = $300,000 total
- Success rate: 70% complete program
- Cost per outcome: $3,000 / 0.70 = **$4,286 per youth retained**

### Use Cases
- Compare programs achieving similar outcomes
- Identify most cost-effective interventions
- Benchmark against existing programs

## Trajectory Uplift Analysis

### Definition
Change in beneficiary life trajectory attributable to intervention, comparing baseline (without program) to intervention (with program) outcomes.

### Methodology

1. **Establish baseline trajectory**: Projected outcomes without intervention
   - Use comparison group data, historical data, or research literature
   - Example: 50% of at-risk youth graduate high school without intervention

2. **Establish intervention trajectory**: Projected outcomes with intervention
   - Use program data, evaluation results, or pilot studies
   - Example: 85% of program participants graduate high school

3. **Calculate uplift**: Difference between intervention and baseline
   - Example: 85% - 50% = **35% uplift** in graduation rate

### Time Horizons
- **Short-term** (1-2 years): Immediate outcomes (crisis stabilization, skill acquisition)
- **Medium-term** (5-10 years): Life transitions (employment, education completion)
- **Long-term** (10-20 years): Life trajectory (earnings, health, family stability)

## Systemic Impact Assessment

### Framework: Upstream, Midstream, Downstream

**Upstream (Prevention - Root Causes)**
- Addresses fundamental systems creating problems
- Examples: Affordable housing policy, living wage campaigns, early childhood development
- Impact: Long-term, prevents problems from occurring

**Midstream (Early Intervention)**
- Catches issues early before they become crises
- Examples: School-based mental health, parenting support, job training
- Impact: Medium-term, reduces severity and duration

**Downstream (Symptom Relief)**
- Treats acute problems after they occur
- Examples: Crisis intervention, emergency assistance, shelter services
- Impact: Short-term, alleviates immediate suffering

### Scoring Systemic Impact
- **Low**: Purely downstream, treats symptoms without addressing causes
- **Medium**: Mix of midstream/downstream, some early intervention
- **High**: Primarily upstream/midstream, prevents problems or catches them early

## Portfolio Strategy Frameworks

### Concentration Risk Guidelines

**By Cause Area**:
- No single cause area >40% of total giving (maintain diversification)
- Balance prevention (upstream) with treatment (downstream)

**By Stage**:
- Target mix: 60% upstream/midstream, 40% downstream
- Prevent "all crisis response" or "all prevention" portfolios

**By Geography**:
- If focused on Singapore, consider regional/international balance (10-20%)
- Geographic concentration acceptable if deeply informed

### Portfolio Balance Principles

1. **Theory of Change Diversity**
   - Include programs addressing problem from multiple angles
   - Example: Education portfolio includes tutoring (midstream), scholarships (downstream), curriculum reform advocacy (upstream)

2. **Risk Profile Mix**
   - Balance proven programs (lower risk) with innovative approaches (higher risk)
   - Typical mix: 70% proven, 30% experimental

3. **Time Horizon Balance**
   - Include short-term wins (visible impact) and long-term investments (systemic change)
   - Avoid all "quick wins" or all "10-year bets"

4. **Beneficiary Breadth**
   - Serve multiple at-risk populations (youth, families, elderly, refugees, etc.)
   - Avoid over-concentration on single demographic

### Strategic Gaps to Fill

Common gaps in Singapore philanthropic landscape:
- **Secondary school support** (most programs focus on primary or post-secondary)
- **Crisis prevention** (heavy emphasis on crisis response, less on prevention)
- **Family systems approaches** (many programs target individuals, not family units)
- **Mental health** (growing need, limited capacity)
- **Employment pathways** (training exists, but job placement and retention support lacking)

## Data Quality Assessment Framework

### Evaluation Rigor Levels

**Level 1: Weak Evidence**
- Self-reported outcomes, no comparison group
- Small sample size (N<50)
- Short follow-up (<6 months)
- High attrition (>40% lost to follow-up)

**Level 2: Moderate Evidence**
- Operational outcome definitions
- Historical or matched comparison group
- Reasonable sample size (N=50-200)
- Medium-term follow-up (6-12 months)
- Moderate attrition (20-40%)

**Level 3: Strong Evidence**
- Randomized control trial or quasi-experimental design
- Large sample size (N>200)
- Long-term follow-up (12+ months)
- Low attrition (<20%)
- Independent evaluation

### Common Data Quality Issues

**Selection Bias**
- Program serves most motivated beneficiaries (success inflated)
- **Mitigation**: Comparison group, random selection, document selection criteria

**Attrition Bias**
- Beneficiaries lost to follow-up may have worse outcomes
- **Mitigation**: Track attrition rates, sensitivity analysis, intention-to-treat analysis

**Reporting Bias**
- Self-reported outcomes may be overstated
- **Mitigation**: Third-party verification, administrative data, objective measures

**Small Sample Bias**
- Small pilot results may not replicate at scale
- **Mitigation**: Larger validation study, external replication, conservative estimates

## Event Planning Principles (for Corporate Team Building)

### Pacing and Energy Management

**Rule of 70/30**: 70% structured activities, 30% unstructured connection time
- Structured time: Organized activities with clear objectives
- Unstructured time: Meals, breaks, travel between activities (organic bonding happens here)

**Energy Curve Consideration**:
- Morning: High energy activities (physical, collaborative challenges)
- Afternoon: Medium energy (workshops, skill-building)
- Evening: Low energy (meals, reflection, social activities)

**Buffer Time Formula**: Add 20% buffer to all time estimates
- 60-minute activity → Schedule 75 minutes
- Accounts for: Late starts, extended discussions, unexpected issues

### Group Size Dynamics

**Small Groups (5-12 people)**
- Everyone participates equally
- Intimate conversations possible
- Activities: Most formats work
- Logistics: Simple

**Medium Groups (13-30 people)**
- May need breakout groups
- Energy level high
- Activities: Most formats work with facilitation
- Logistics: Moderate complexity

**Large Groups (31-50+ people)**
- Require professional facilitation
- Breakout groups essential
- Activities: Scalable formats only
- Logistics: High complexity (transportation, venues, coordination)

### Activity Selection Criteria

**Bonding Potential vs Entertainment Value**
- High bonding, high entertainment: Ideal (collaborative cooking, escape rooms, problem-solving challenges)
- High bonding, low entertainment: Acceptable (service projects, skill workshops)
- Low bonding, high entertainment: Avoid (spectator events, passive entertainment)
- Low bonding, low entertainment: Never use

**Accessibility Checklist**:
- [ ] Physical alternatives available for low-mobility participants
- [ ] Dietary restrictions accommodated (vegetarian, halal, allergies)
- [ ] Introvert-friendly pacing (breaks, opt-out options)
- [ ] Financial barriers removed (company covers all costs)
- [ ] Cultural/religious sensitivity (avoid alcohol-required events, religiously sensitive timing)

### Logistics Planning Framework

**Booking Timeline**:
- 6-8 weeks out: Venue, major activities, facilitators
- 4-5 weeks out: Transportation, catering, materials
- 2-3 weeks out: Final headcount, dietary confirmations, logistics details
- 1 week out: Participant communications, contingency planning

**Contingency Planning**:
- Weather contingencies for outdoor activities (indoor backup options)
- Venue issues (alternative venue identified)
- Timing problems (activities ranked by priority, can cut lowest priority if time short)
- Transportation delays (buffer time built in)
- Last-minute cancellations (activities work with range of group sizes)
